Cement is a calcined, powdered ceramic that, with the addition of water, can be molded or poured and then sets into a solid mass, bonding well to many surfaces. There are many different cements; the one most widely used construction is Portland cement, so called because the developers sought to promote it as resembling Portland stone, a layered limestone much valued for floors and pavings (the resemblance is a poor one). It is made by calcining a mixture of chalk or limestone and clay, followed by grinding to a fine powder. Mixed with water, it hydrates and sets to a hard gray solid. Portland cement can be used neat, but is more usually used as a binder with aggregates to make mortar and concrete.","Vast quantities of cement are used to make concrete for general civil engineering construction, where there is little exposure to sulfates in soil or groundwater.

The matrix is cement; the reinforcement, a mixture of sand and gravel ('aggregate') occupying 60-80% of the volume. The aggregate increases the stiffness and strength and reduces the cost (aggregate is cheap). Concrete is strong in compression but cracks easily in tension. This is countered by adding steel reinforcement in the form of wire, mesh or bars ('rebar'), often with surface contours to key it into the concrete; reinforced concrete can carry useful loads even when the concrete is cracked. Still higher performance is gained by using steel wire reinforcement that is pre-tensioned before the concrete sets. On relaxing the tension, the wires pull the concrete into compression; the concrete does not crack until the loads applied to it overcome this compression stress ('pre-stressed concrete').",General civil engineering construction and...,"-2001

1025,1025_2,N/A,"GFRP, epoxy matrix (isotropic)",Hybrids,Hybrids: Composites,"Composites are one of the great material developments of the 20th century. Those with the highest stiffness and strength are made of continuous fibers (glass, carbon or Kevlar, an aramid) embedded in a thermosetting resin (polyester or epoxy). The fibers carry the mechanical loads, while the matrix material transmits loads to the fibers and provides ductility and toughness as well as protecting the fibers from damage caused by handling or the environment. It is the matrix material that limits the service temperature and processing conditions. Polyester-glass composites (GFRPs) are the cheapest and by far the most widely used. A recent innovation is the use of thermoplastics at the matrix material, either in the form of a co-weave of cheap polypropylene and glass fibers that is thermoformed, melting the PP, or as expensive high-temperature thermoplastic resins such as PEEK that allow composites with higher temperature and impact resistance. High performance GFRP uses continuous fibers. Those with chopped glass fibers are cheaper and are used in far larger quantities. GFRP products range from tiny electronic circuit boards to large boat hulls, body and interior panels of cars, household appliances, furniture and fittings.","Sports equipment such as skis, racquets, skate boards and golf club shafts, ship and boat hulls; body shells; automobile components; cladding and fittings in construction; chemical plant.","-2001

1026,1026_2,N/A,"Sheet molding compound, SMC, polyester matrix",Hybrids,Hybrids: Composites,"Lay-up and filament winding methods of shaping composites are far too slow and labor-intensive to compete with steel pressings for car body panels and other enclosures. Sheet molding compounds (SMCs) and dough (or bulk) molding compounds (DMCs or BMCs) overcome this by allowing molding in a single operation between heated dies. To make SMC, polyester resin containing thickening agents and cheap particulates like calcium carbonate or silica dust is mixed with chopped fibers -- usually glass -- to form a sheet. The fibers lie more or less parallel to the plane of the sheet, but are randomly oriented in-plane, with a volume fraction between 15% and 40%. DMC is made in a similar way, but the mix has a higher concentration of filler and a lower volume fraction of chopped fiber (10% to 25%), which are randomly oriented in 3-dimensions. This makes a ""pre-preg"" with leather or dough-like consistency. When SMC sheet is pressed between hot dies it polymerizes, giving a strong, stiff sheet molding. DMC is molded in closed, heated dies to make more complex shapes - door handles, shaped levers, parts for washing machines and the like.","Sheet pressings of all types, competing with steel and aluminum sheet.

1047,1047_2,N/A,Low alloy steel,Metals,Metals: Ferrous,"Pure iron is soft stuff. Add carbon and heat-treat it right, and you can get a material that is almost as hard and brittle as glass, or as ductile and tough as boiler plate. 'Heat treat' means heating the steel to about 800 C to dissolve the carbon, then quenching (rapid cooling, often by dropping into cold water) and tempering - reheating it to a lower temperature and holding it there. Quenching turns the steel into hard, brittle 'martensite'; tempering slowly restores the toughness and brings the hardness down. Control of tempering time and temperature gives control of properties. It's wonderful what 1% of carbon can do. But (the inevitable 'but') the cooling rate in that initial quench has to be fast - more than 200 C/second for plain carbon steels. There is no difficulty in transforming the surface of a component to martensite, but the interior cools more slowly because heat has to be conducted out. If the component is more than a few millimeters thick, there is a problem - the inside doesn't cool fast enough. The problem is overcome by alloying. Add a little manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), or chromium (Cr), and the critical cooling rate comes down, allowing thick sections to be hardened and then tempered. Adding some vanadium, V, as well allows a dispersion of carbides giving strength while retaining toughness and ductility. Chrome-molybdenum steels such as AIS 4140 are used for aircraft tubing and other high strength parts. Chrome-vanadium steels are used for crank and propeller shafts and high quality tools. Steels alloyed for this purpose are called low alloy steels, and the property they have is called 'hardenability'.","Springs, tools, ball bearings, rollers; crankshafts, gears, connecting rods, knives and scissors, pressure.","-2001

The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds. The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and between 6000 BC and 5000 BC in the Indus Valley Civilization. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.",Fabric and ropes; bandages.,-2004,-3077,,,
