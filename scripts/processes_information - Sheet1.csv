Many are rigid, giving a stiff bond (see the record for Rigid Adhesives); but flexible adhesives also play an important role in design. They are classified by their chemical composition.
 
 Flexible adhesives are typified by polyurethanes include and isocyanate-based adhesives, with lap shear strengths of about 8 MPa. They bond well to a wide range of materials, are tough and flexible, have good resistance to water and solvents, and perform well from -50 Â°C to 80 Â°C.
 
 Silicones (SIL) are synthetic polymers in which silicon replaces carbon as the major chain element. Most are two-part systems, their chemistry gives them exceptional flexibility and chemical stability. They are flexible, have useful properties from -115Â°C- 260 Â°C, good resistance to water and UV and IR radiation."

They are now used in every industrial sector. Some are flexible (see record for Flexible Adhesives) but most are rigid, giving a stiff bond. Within each group, it is usual to use a classification based on chemistry.
 
 Epoxies and epoxy-phenolics are thermosetting adhesives with high tensile strengths (up to 45 MPa) and low peel strengths (1.8 kg/mm). They are resistant to solvents, acids, bases and salts. Nylon-epoxies have the highest strengths and are used primarily to bond aluminum, magnesium and steel. Epoxy-phenolics retain their strength up to 150 - 250 Â°C and are used to bond metals, glass and phenolic resins. Most are two-part systems, curing at temperatures between 20 - 175 Â°C, depending on grade. They are used in relatively small quantities because of price: but, with imide-based adhesives, they dominate the high-performance adhesives markets. They give good adhesion to a wide range of substrates, with low shrinkage and good mechanical properties from -250 to +250 Â°C.
 
 Acrylic adhesives are two-part systems that form a strong, impact resistant bonding layer when mixed or activated by UV radiation. They are durable, tough, water resistant, optically clear, and able to bond a wide range of materials. They are most used for wood-to-metal bonds.
 Cyanoacrylate adhesives are familiar as 'super glue'. They are single part systems that cure in seconds when exposed to damp air, to give a strong, rather brittle bond. They bond to practically anything, and do so 'instantly' requiring no heat or clamping.
 
 Phenolic adhesives are as old as Bakelite (1905), which they resemble chemically. Phenolics are sometimes blended with epoxies and neoprenes. They have high strength, good water resistance and heat resistance, and are flame retardant.
 Imide-based adhesives (dismaleimides, BMI and polyimides, PI), like epoxies, are widely used as a matrix in fiber-reinforced polymers. They have better elevated temperature performance than most other organic adhesives. Used to bond ceramics and metals. They have excellent dielectric properties (hence their used in radomes); BMIs can be used at temperatures as low as -250 Â°C and as high as 230 Â°C; PIs up to 300Â°C."

RIVETS are widely used in aircraft design - a testament to their strength, permanence and reliability. Riveting is done by inserting a stud with a head on one end through pre-drilled holes in the mating components, and clinching (squashing) the other end where it sticks out by hitting it with a shaped hammer. STAPLES - familiar as a way of binding paper and attaching leather and cloth to frames in furniture - are fast and cheap; they can also be used to assemble sheet metal. Staples are applied with a spring-loaded, electric or pneumatic jig that forces the staple through the materials and onto a grooved anvil, bending the legs inwards and pinching the materials together. In blind stapling there is no anvil - the legs of the staple are simply driven through one material into the other, where they stick in the same way that nails do."

In sewing, a series of stitches are applied, using one or more continuous threads of fibers, to join two or more thicknesses of material. There are many types of stitching, broadly described as 'lock stitch' in which loops of one thread pass through the material and are locked on the other side by a second thread; or 'chain stitch' in which a single thread zigzags through the material. Sewing machines automate the process. The figure shows a chain stitch of a single lap joint."

 cheap and - if designed to do so - they can be disassembled. It is essential that the snap can tolerate the relatively
 large elastic deflection required for assembly or disassembly. Polymers, particularly, meet this requirement, though
 springy metals, too, make good snap fits."

 In INERTIAL FRICTION WELDING, the motor drives a fly wheel that is disconnected from the motor to make the weld.

The central pin and shoulder compact the two parts to be joined, heating and plasticizing the materials. As the tool moves along the joint line, material from the front of the tool is swept around to the rear, eliminating the interface.

 In DIFFUSION BONDING the surfaces to be joined are cleaned, pressed into close contact and heated in vacuum or a controlled atmosphere. Solid state diffusion creates the bond, which is of high quality, but the process is slow and the temperatures are high. GLAZE BONDING depends on the fact that molten glass wets and bonds to almost anything.

The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into heat when it hits the work piece, which has to be contained in a vacuum chamber, and it must be a conductor. No filler metal is used. The process is more energy-efficient than laser-beam welding, allowing higher power densities and the ability to weld thicker plates. In LASER BEAM WELDING, the heat source is a narrow beam of coherent monochromatic light. The process is more precise than e-beam welding and takes place in air, allowing greater design freedom, but the penetration depth is less (maximum 20mm in metals). Shielding gas is blown though a surrounding nozzle to protect the weld. Again, no filler metal is used. It is possible to laser weld thin, semi-transparent or opaque polymer films by simply scanning the beam across them, melting them right through, but this is not the best way to use lasers. The trick in welding polymers is to arrange that the beam is absorbed where it is most useful - at the joint interface. For transparent polymers this can be achieved by spraying a thin film of IR or UV-absorbing dye, invisible to the human eye, onto the surface where the weld is wanted; the laser beam passes through the transparent upper sheet (which can be thick - up to 10mm) without much energy loss. But when it hits the dye of the interface it is strongly absorbed, melting the polymer there and creating a weld whilst leaving most of the rest of the material cold. Scanning the beam or tracking the work piece gives a line weld up to 10mm wide."

In RESISTANCE SPOT WELDING, the overlapping sheets are pressed between water cooled electrodes. The current-pulse generates heat; the cooled electrodes chill the surfaces, localizing the heat in the interface between the sheets where the metal melts and welds. PROJECTION SPOT WELDING uses an additional trick - a pre-formed pimple on the face of the joint - to confine the current path and further localize the heating; a clever idea, because it extends the use of the method to forgings, castings and machined components and makes it faster because several welds can be made at the same time.

 less strong than brazed joints - more like an adhesive - but the equipment needed to make them is simpler and the temperatures reached by the component are much lower, an essential for the assembly of electronic equipment. Soldering can be applied in the same way as braze, or - more like an adhesive - by pre-coating ('tinning') the metal surfaces to be joined before assembling and simply heating them with a torch, an electric soldering iron, or an array of infra-red lamps. In RE-FLOW SOLDERING, the components are heated by vapor from a boiling fluorinated hydrocarbon that condenses on components, releasing latent heat, and giving rapid, uniform heating. There are pressures to replace lead-based solders because of the potential toxicity of heavy metals, but viable alternatives are not yet widely available."

When complete the very porous model is infiltrated with liquid bronze, which wets and is drawn into the porosity. This gives a fully dense product, with a complex external and internal shape (such as cooling channels) that can be used as a die for injection molding and die casting.

The lost wax process - the old name for INVESTMENT CASTING - has been practiced for at least three thousand years; sophisticated jewelry, ornaments and icon were being made in Egypt and Greece well before 1500BC. In investment casting, wax patterns are made and assembled (if small) into a tree with feeding and gating systems. The assembled pattern is dipped into refractory slurry, then covered in refractory stucco and allowed to dry. The procedure is repeated a number of times until about 8 layers have built up, creating a ceramic investment shell. The wax is then melted out and the ceramic shell fired before the molten metal is cast. Gravity die casting is adequate for simple shapes, but air pressure, vacuum or centrifugal pressure is needed to give complete filling of the mold when complex, thin sections are involved. The mold is broken up to remove the castings. The process is suitable for most metals of melting temperatures below 2200 C. Because the wax pattern is melted out, the shape can be very complex, with contours, undercuts, bosses, and recesses. For making hollow shapes, this process is very sophisticated: all large bronze statues are hollow, and they are made by an elaboration of this process."

Add a binder and much more complex shapes become possible. And sand is a refractory; even iron can be cast in it. In GREEN SAND CASTING, a mixture of sand and clay is compacted in the split mold around a pattern that has the shape of the desired casting. The pattern is removed to leave the cavity in which the metal is poured. Cheap wooden patterns, with gates and risers attached, are used when the batch size is small and the process is manual, but this is slow and labor intensive. Automated systems use aluminum patterns and automated compaction. The sand mold is referred to as 'green' when it is used in a moist condition. Dry sand molds are stronger and more rigid, and thus are used in making large heavy castings.

In SHELL CASTING, a mixture of fine-grained sand and thermosetting resin is applied to a heated metal pattern (aluminum or cast iron) and cured to form a shell. Two matching shells are then joined to form a complete mold which is then placed in a frame packed with sand. The process gives good surface finish and better dimensionality than conventional sand casting."

In roll forming a continuous strip of sheet metal is fed through a series of shaped rolls, gradually forming it to the desired profile. The process is suited for long lengths of constant, sometimes complex, cross sections. Hollow components are possible by incorporating seem welding into the process. High production rates, tooling and capital costs make the process economic only for large production levels. In Spinning a circular blank of sheet metal is formed over a rotating mandrill or forming block, against which it is pressed by a rigid tool or roller as it spins.

Circular sawing produces a wider cut than band sawing, although circular saws as thin as 1.5 mm (0.060 in.) are available. Thin blades, however, cannot maintain the tolerances and high cutting forces for which circular sawing is noted."

The workpiece is held by a mechanical or magnetic grip that can be tracked or rotated beneath the grinding wheel (if small) or held stationary beneath the moving wheel (if large) while unwanted material is removed using an abrasive grinding wheel. Grinding works best on hard surfaces; soft metals smear and contaminate (""glaze"") the wheel. Grinding processes are expensive and should be used only when absolutely necessary."

The workpiece is gripped in a chuck mounted in a lathe that provides the rotary motion. BORING is this same action applied to internal surfaces of revolution. It is the most commonly used process for enlarging or finishing holes or other circular contours. Although most boring operations are done on simple, straight-through holes (ranging upward in diameter from about 6 mm), tooling can be designed for boring blind holes, holes with bottle-shaped configurations and bores with steps, undercuts, and counterbores. Boring is used after drilling to increase dimensional accuracy and finish, and for finishing holes too large to be produced economically by drilling, such as large cored holes in castings or large pierced holes in forgings. PARTING is the separation of a turned object from the stock from which it was made by turning the section down to zero."

The jet is focused through a nozzle made of tungsten or sapphire to resist abrasion. It is used for machining delicate or very hard materials. The process has the advantage of producing no heat damage to workpiece surfaces. A taper is produced in deep cuts. The distance of the nozzle from the workpiece affects the size of the machined area and the removal rate.

A power supply generates rapid electric pulses that create a discharge between the workpiece and wire electrode. The discharge causes the melting, and probably the vaporization, of a minute piece of material, slowly eating into the work piece. Any electrical conductive material can be machined irrespective of hardness. The wire is positioned relative to the workpiece by numerical control. On some machines the wire can be tilted to create tapered parts. An advantage of this process is that no mechanical stresses are created in the workpiece because the wire does not make contact with it."

In extrusion blow molding a tube or parison is extruded and clamped in a split mold with a hollow mandrel at one end. Hot air is forced under pressure through the mandrel, blowing the polymer against the mold walls where it cools and freezes. In injection blow molding, a pre-form is injection molded over a mandrel and transferred to the blowing die. Air is injected under pressure through the mandrel blowing the polymer against the mold walls where it cools and freezes, as before. The process gives better control over finished component weight and wall thickness than extrusion blow-molding, with better precision in the unblown, injection molded neck areas, lending itself to screw closures, etc. Solid handles can be molded in. In stretch blow molding, an important variant, the temperature is chosen such that the polymer is drawn as it expands, orienting the molecules in the plane of the surface. It is used in the production of PET drink bottles."

The mold is closed creating sufficient pressure to force the polymer into the mold cavity. The polymer is allowed to cure, the mold is opened and the component removed. A variant, polymer forging, is used to form thermoplastics that are difficult to mold, such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, or shapes that have thick walls or large and abrupt changes in section area. Compression molding is widely used to shape the composites BMC and SMC. BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) and SMC (Sheet Molding Compound) differ in the shape and content of reinforcement and filler. BMC has less (15-25% of glass fiber) and it is the easiest to mold to 3-dimensional shapes. SMC has more (up to 35%) of glass fiber and is limited to sheet shapes. DMC (Dough Molding Compound) is the genesis - a dough-like mix of thermosetting polyester, polyurethane or epoxy with hardener, chopped glass fiber, filler and coloring agent. Two more - GMT (Glass Mat Thermoplastics) and TSC (Thermoplastic Sheet Compounds) - are the thermoplastic equivalent, based on nylon 6 or polypropylene. The word ""dough"" conveys well the way in which they are shaped: squeezed between a pair of dies, like a pie crust."

The softened particles are transferred to aluminum molds (to give good heat transfer) and steam-heated at 3 atmospheres, causing them to expand to 20 or more times their original volume and fuse together, filling the mold and taking up its shape."

The raw materials as powder granules or pellets are fed into a barrel with one or more rotating screws in a heating chamber and the resulting melt is forced through a shaped die orifice. The process blends, compounds, homogenizes and extrudes the polymer mix at temperatures between 135 and 370 C. The extrudate is cooled as it leaves the die, using air or water cooling; it may subsequently be 'drawn down' to a smaller cross-section. Variations of the process include film blowing, extrusion blow molding and filament forming. The process is used to coat wire, which can be achieved at high speeds. Extrusion is also used as a pre-process other molding processes such as injection molding, producing polymer blends in pellet form.
 The process has the advantage of relatively low tooling costs, though capital costs are high and the output usually requires further processing, varying from simply cutting to size to remelting and injection molding.
 Die design is complicated by 'die swell' -- the expansion of the section after it leaves the die, caused by the visco-elastic nature of flow in long-chain polymers. Because of this the tolerances are not as tight as for pressure molding processes, though this can be improved by running the extruded section through a second ""sizing"" die."

This tumbles and melts the powder, coating the inside walls of the mold to a thickness set by the initial load of powder, creating a hollow shell. The component then cools in a dwell cycle, the mold chilled by air or water spray. The process is best suited for components that are large, hollow and closed; although small, thin-walled components can be made and open shapes can be created by subsequent machining."

In POWDER PRESSING AND SINTERING, the loose powder is packed in a shaped mold of steel, graphite or ceramic in which it is sintered at a temperature, typically, of 2/3 of the melting temperature of the powder. In pressing and sintering, the powder is first compressed in a cold die, giving it just sufficient strength to be handled, allowing it to be sintered as a free-standing body. Better densification, strength and ductility are given by hot pressing, which combines compaction and sintering into one operation. The powder is heated in a graphite or ceramic die under sufficient pressure to compact the powder to nearly full density. The process is mainly used for components that are too large for regular cold pressing and sintering. Its use is limited by the cost of dies, the difficulty in heating and atmospheric control and the length of time required for a cycle. Vacuum hot pressing is used for powders that are particularly sensitive to contamination by oxygen or nitrogen (titanium is an example)."

--1048 (Low carbon steel)
--1049 (Medium carbon steel)",,"In CARBURISING, additional carbon is diffused into the surface of a low-carbon steel to give a high-carbon surface layer. When this is quenched, the layer transforms to a hard, brittle, martensite, which can subsequently be tempered to obtain the required balance of hardness and toughness. There are three broad classes of carburizing equipment; all require temperatures of about 900 C. The first uses a powder pack that releases carbon monoxide (CO); this decomposes on the surface of the steel to give atomic carbon and CO2. It is best for small parts. The second uses a fused salt bath containing sodium cyanide (NaCN>25%), barium chloride, sodium chloride and accelerators; it is very versatile and has a low capital cost. The last uses gas - methane, butane or pentane - as the source of carbon in a special muffle furnace that allows the gas to flow freely round the parts to be carburized; it lends itself to large-quantity production.
 
 
 CARBO-NITRIDING is a variant of gas carburizing in which ammonia (NH3) is added to the carburizing gas. Nitrogen, released from the ammonia, and carbon from the carburizing gas, diffuse into the component at the same time, precipitating nitrides as well as increasing the surface carbon content. It generally requires a lower temperature and shorter time than plain carburizing. The process produces a thinner layer, but one that retains its hardness to higher temperatures.
 
 
 Both processes give components with hard, wear resistant surfaces on a tough, ductile core. Carburizing gives better impact resistance than carbo-nitriding, but it causes more distortion and is slower, making it more expensive."

The result is a tough body with a hard, wear and fatigue resistant, surface skin. Both processes allow the surface of carbon steels to be hardened with minimum distortion or oxidation. In INDUCTION HARDENING, a high frequency (up to 50kHz) electromagnetic field induces eddy-currents in the surface of the work-piece, locally heating it; the depth of hardening depends on the frequency. In FLAME HARDENING, heat is applied instead by high-temperature gas burners, followed, as before, by rapid cooling.

The laser beam scans the surface to cause a phase change for localized heat treatment, or to melt it for localized structure-change. This allows three sorts of process: surface transformation hardening, surface shocking, and surface melting and glazing. All can be applied to selected areas of the surface.
 
 
 In SURFACE TRANSFORMATION HARDENING (limited to carbon and alloy steels) the beam heats a spot on the surface to a temperature above that for the transmission to austenite. As the beam moves on, the hotspot is quenched by conduction of heat into the massive, cold interior of the component, transforming a thin surface layer to martensite. Single, separated tracks give a surface with good wear resistance - the alternating the hard and soft bands contribute to this. Overlapping tracks give a more uniform hardening of the entire surface.
 
 
 LASER SHOCK HARDENING uses a pulsed, high energy beam to violently vaporize a minute amount of surface material, creating a shock wave that locally deforms the underlying solid, while hardening it like shock peening.
 
 
 LASER SURFACE MELTING involves the use of a high intensity beam to scan the surface, protected by a shielding-gas, melting it. The subsequent rapid quench by conduction into the interior produces a track with a refined and homogenized microstructure. Laser glazing is a melting process carried out at a high processing speed such as the cooling rates between 10,000 and 1,000,000Â°C/sec can be achieved. At this cooling rate, metallic glass formation is possible if the alloy composition has a high glass-forming tendency."

The temperature - 495 to 565 C - is lower than that for carburizing, giving less distortion, and the surface does not require later heat treatment (as carburizing does) to acquire its hardness.

The image is printed on a thin, water-soluble film; when floated on water, the image floats free and can be transferred to the product to which it sticks. CUBIC PRINTING uses the same principle, scaled-up and made commercially viable. The film and its image are floated on the surface of a water tank. The product is immersed in the tank, where the pressure of the water presses the image onto the surface of the component."

The anode is inert - usually graphite or stainless steel, and the electrolyte is an aqueous solution in which the pigment is emulsified. An alkaline environment builds up at the cathode, causing the lacquer to coagulate. The charged particles of pigment are dragged by the field onto the surface of the component where they form a strongly bonded film. The film is relatively thin (13 - 15 microns), but gives good corrosion resistance, particularly if baked at 150 - 230 C after deposition. Other layers of paint are applied on top. The principle can be compared with electro-plating, and is widely used in the automobile industry.
 
 
 In AUTOPHORETIC PAINTING the component is submerged in a bath of emulsified pigment. Ion exchange between the component and the solution causes the charged particle of paint to be attracted to the component where they merge to form a continuous film."

It is best known as a method of applying metallic gold or silver lettering or decoration. A heated metal die (250-300 C) is pressed against a colored carrier foil and the component being printed. The hot stamp is created when the raised surface of the die contacts the foil and transfers the colored film on the face of the foil to the product being printed. The pressure from the die creates a recess for marking, which protects the stamped letter from abrasion, and heat makes the marking medium adhere to the product."

When spread thin over a surface, the solvent evaporates; the resins hold the pigments in place to form a decorative and protective coating. Some few paints are not much more than this today. Watching paint dry is a synonym for boredom. But modern paints are far from boring. New developments now give formulations that dry in seconds, have fade-resistant colors, soft textures, visual effects, powerful protective qualities, and much more. But there is a problem. Solvent-based paints are environmentally bad, so bad that their very future is under threat."

--1136 (TORLON PAI)",,"PAD PRINTING is a little like printing with rubber stamps; instead of rubber, the image is cut into a steel or copper plate, from which it is lifted by a rubber pad. It is used as a decorating process for irregular shapes, and for those shapes which cannot be easily printed by silk screen. The steps are as follows. (1) The image to be transferred is etched into a printing plate commonly referred to as a cliche. The cliche is flooded with ink and wiped, leaving ink only in the image area. As solvents evaporate from the image area the ink's ability to adhere the silicone transfer pad increases. (2) The pad is pressed onto the cliche lifting the ink. Solvents evaporate from the outer ink layer where it is exposed to the atmosphere, making it tackier and more viscous. (3) The pad is pressed onto the component to be decorated, conforming to its shape and depositing the ink. Even though it compresses considerably during this step, the contoured pad is designed to roll away from the substrate surface without smudging the image by sliding. (4) When the pad is pressed onto the product, the adhesion between the ink and substrate is greater than the adhesion between the ink and pad, resulting in complete transfer of the ink, leaving the pad clean and ready for the next cycle. Automatic methods, with several pads in series (transfer pad printing), allow cheap multi-color decoration. Manual machines are used for low production volumes; for these, multi-color prints require separate steps and require set-up time."

He used silk stretched on frames to support hand painted stencils, a process also used by William Morris to create his famous wallpapers and textile prints. During the First World War in America screen printing took off as an industrial printing process; but it was the invention of the photographic stencil in the 1930s that revolutionized the process. It is now a $5 billion per year industry."

The enameled masks of the Pharaohs of Egypt look as bright, vibrant and perfect today as they did when they were created over 3000 years ago (Tutankhamen, BC 1358 - 1340). A thin layer of glass powder with binder and coloring agent is applied to the object to be enameled by painting or screen printing; the layer is then fused to the object, generally made of cast iron, pressed steel, copper, silver or even - in the case of Tutankhamen - of gold, creating a continuous, strongly-bonded coating of colored glass. It is a hot process - the object being enameled must be heated to the melting temperature of the glass powder - limiting it to use on metals and ceramics."

That is because the soap dissolves faster at the peaks of the roughness than at the troughs because the local concentration gradient is steeper there. CHEMICAL POLISHING relies on a similar principle. It is a process whereby a surface is smoothed by controlled chemical dissolution in a bath of acid containing additives that, by creating a surface boundary-layer, cause protrusions to dissolve faster than flat or intruded components of the surface - there is no external power supply. The process is normally carried out at high temperatures to increase the polishing rate. Chemical polishing, like electro-polishing, is a way of brightening a surface, enhancing reflectivity, but without the dimensional precision of mechanical polishing. Much cheaper, of course."

The component is connected to the positive side of a low voltage direct current power source while a cathode is connected to the negative side, both immersed in a conductive solution. During the process, a layer of oxides or salts forms on the surface of the component; the layer controls the dissolution so that high points of a rough surface are dissolved faster than lower points. The final result is a metal surface with a smooth glossy appearance."

The areas or patterns to be etched are exposed to an acid; the areas that are not to be etched are protected with a wax resist. Glass used to be etched by hydrofluoric acid, a particularly nasty chemical that gives off poisonous fumes; today this has largely been replaced by proprietary etch-gels, by sand etching or by engraving with a diamond tool. Copper, zinc, nickel and steel are etched in various combinations of sulfuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids. These, too, create environmental problems. SAND ETCHING makes use of a jet of angular sand particles in a pressurized gas stream to erode the surface where it is not protected by a mask. The rate of etching and the fineness of the finish depend on the air pressure and sand particles size. The method also works well with polymers. ELECTRO-ETCHING is a non-toxic way of etching of metals. Here the acid bath is replaced by one of copper sulfate (for etching copper) or zinc sulfate (for etching zinc) that never has to be changed. The object, protected by wax resists where necessary, is made the anode (+) of an electro-polishing bath, cutting into the areas of surface not protected by the resist."

 GRINDING is a cruder process, but still one that allows precision in dimensioning and finishing a surface. It works best on hard surfaces; soft surfaces smear and contaminate ('glaze') the grinding wheel."

By SAND BLASTING, or abrasive polishing, the microscopic roughening of the surface in a random or patterned way (as in 'brushed aluminum'). By LASER TEXTURING, usually applied to rolls or dies; the pulsed laser beam creates minute craters on the roll surface in a precisely controlled pattern that is then transferred to the component during the rolling operation.

The film can be thickened and its structure controlled by the process of ANODISING. The process is electrolytic; the electrolyte, typically, is dilute (15%) sulfuric acid. The object to be anodized is made the anode (+) of the bath, with a potential difference of a few volts between it and the inert cathode.

Metal ions from the solution are deposited on the catalytic surface of the component by the action of a chemical reducing agent present in a metallic salt solution. In the case of electro-less plating of nickel (the most significant commercial application of the process), the salt is nickel chloride and the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphate. Once started the reaction can continue and there is no theoretical limit to the thickness of the coating. Electro-less plating is used when it is impossible or impractical to use normal electroplating - when complex internal surfaces are to be plated, or when dimensional accuracy of the component is critical, for instance."

The molten metal alloys with the surface of the component, forming a continuous thin coating. When the coating is zinc and the component is steel, the process is known as Galvanizing.
 
 
 The process is very versatile and can be applied to components of any shape, and sizes up to 30 m x 2 m x 4 m. The cost is comparable with that of painting, but the protection offered by galvanizing is much greater, because if the coating is scratched it is the zinc not the underlying steel that corrodes (""galvanic protection"").

All use a heat source to melt the coating material and a high velocity gas jet to break it into small droplets and propel them to the surface to be coated.
 
 
 In wire flame spraying, a continuous wire or rod is fed into an oxyacetylene flame, which melts it and disperses it into droplets 10 to 100 microns in diameter. The gas stream accelerates them to 90 to 25 m/s and propels them towards the surface at a distance 100 to 250 mm from the gun. The molten particles strike the surface and flow into thin, flat droplets that overlap, interlock and bond as they solidify. Multiple passes allow thick coatings to be built up."

--1138 (Wlanut (transverse))",--3060 (Frying Pan (Cast Iron)),"ELECTROSTATIC POWDER COATING is an efficient, widely used process for applying decorative and protective finishes to metallic or conducting components. The powder is a mixture of finely ground pigment and resin that is sprayed through a negatively charged nozzle onto a surface to be coated. The charged powder particles adhere to the surface of the electrically grounded component. The charge difference attracts the powder to the component at places where the powder layer (which is insulating) is thinnest, building up a uniform layer and minimizing powder loss. The component is subsequently heated to fuse the layer into a smooth coating in a curing oven. The result is a uniform, durable coating of high quality and attractive finish. Powder coating is the fastest growing finishing technology in North America, representing over 10% of all industrial finishing. In polymer flame coating, a thermoplastic in powder form (80-200 Î¼m) is fed from a hopper into a gas-air flame that melts the powder and propels it onto the surface to be coated. The process is versatile, can be mechanized or operated manually, and can build up coatings as thick as 1 mm. A wide range of thermoplastic powders can be used and the process is cheap. The disadvantages: line-of-sight deposition, and surface finish that is inferior to other processes.
 
 
 In FLUIDISED BED COATING the component, heated to 200 - 400 C, is immersed for 1 to 10 seconds in a tank containing coating powder, fluidized by a stream of air at 0.1 - 0.5 atmospheres. The hot component melts the particles, which adhere to it, forming a thick coating with excellent adhesion.
 
 
 In ELECTROSTATIC BED COATING the bed is similar but the air stream is electrically charged as it enters the bed. The ionized air charges the particles as they move upward, forming a cloud of charged particles. The grounded component is covered by the charged particles as it enters the chamber. No preheating of the component is required but a subsequent hot curing is necessary. The process is particularly suitable for coating small objects with simple geometries."

--1136 (TORLON PAI)",,"Mirrors used to be made by a complex process involving silver dissolved in mercury. Today they are made by PVD METALLIZING, a process in which a thin coating of metal - usually aluminum - is deposited from a vapor onto a component. The vapor is created in a vacuum chamber by direct heating or electron beam heating of the metal, from which it condenses onto the cold component, much like steam from a hot bath condensing on a bathroom mirror. In PVD metallizing there is no potential difference between bath and component. In ION PLATING the vapor is ionized and accelerated by an electric field (the component is the cathode, and the metallizing source material is the anode). In sputtering, argon ions are accelerated by the electric field onto a metal target, ejecting metal ions onto the component surface. By introducing a reactive gas, compounds can be formed (Ti sputtering in an atmosphere of N2, to give a hard coating of TiN, for instance)."
