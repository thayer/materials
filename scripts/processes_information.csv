Flexible Adhesives,Joining,'Joining: Adhesives','',2001_flexible_adhesive,"-- Woodshop (https://hop.dartmouth.edu/online/woodworking)-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html)","Structural adhesives are those that are used to perform some mechanical function, though they may have a secondary role as a sealant. Many are rigid, giving a stiff bond (see the record for Rigid Adhesives); but flexible adhesives also play an important role in design. They are classified by their chemical composition.Flexible adhesives are typified by polyurethanes include and isocyanate-based adhesives, with lap shear strengths of about 8 MPa. They bond well to a wide range of materials, are tough and flexible, have good resistance to water and solvents, and perform well from -50 Â°C to 80 Â°C.Silicones (SIL) are synthetic polymers in which silicon replaces carbon as the major chain element. Most are two-part systems, their chemistry gives them exceptional flexibility and chemical stability. They are flexible, have useful properties from -115Â°C- 260 Â°C, good resistance to water and UV and IR radiation."
Rigid Adhesives,Joining,'Joining: Adhesives','',2002_rigid_adhesives,"-- Woodshop (https://hop.dartmouth.edu/online/woodworking)-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html)","Structural adhesives are those with a mechanical function, though they may have a secondary role as a sealant. They are now used in every industrial sector. Some are flexible (see record for Flexible Adhesives) but most are rigid, giving a stiff bond. Within each group, it is usual to use a classification based on chemistry.Epoxies and epoxy-phenolics are thermosetting adhesives with high tensile strengths (up to 45 MPa) and low peel strengths (1.8 kg/mm). They are resistant to solvents, acids, bases and salts. Nylon-epoxies have the highest strengths and are used primarily to bond aluminum, magnesium and steel. Epoxy-phenolics retain their strength up to 150 - 250 Â°C and are used to bond metals, glass and phenolic resins. Most are two-part systems, curing at temperatures between 20 - 175 Â°C, depending on grade. They are used in relatively small quantities because of price: but, with imide-based adhesives, they dominate the high-performance adhesives markets. They give good adhesion to a wide range of substrates, with low shrinkage and good mechanical properties from -250 to +250 Â°C.Acrylic adhesives are two-part systems that form a strong, impact resistant bonding layer when mixed or activated by UV radiation. They are durable, tough, water resistant, optically clear, and able to bond a wide range of materials. They are most used for wood-to-metal bonds.Cyanoacrylate adhesives are familiar as 'super glue'. They are single part systems that cure in seconds when exposed to damp air, to give a strong, rather brittle bond. They bond to practically anything, and do so 'instantly' requiring no heat or clamping.Phenolic adhesives are as old as Bakelite (1905), which they resemble chemically. Phenolics are sometimes blended with epoxies and neoprenes. They have high strength, good water resistance and heat resistance, and are flame retardant.Imide-based adhesives (dismaleimides, BMI and polyimides, PI), like epoxies, are widely used as a matrix in fiber-reinforced polymers. They have better elevated temperature performance than most other organic adhesives. Used to bond ceramics and metals. They have excellent dielectric properties (hence their used in radomes); BMIs can be used at temperatures as low as -250 Â°C and as high as 230 Â°C; PIs up to 300Â°C."
Rivets and Staples,Joining,'Joining: Fasteners','',2003_rivets_staples,-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html),"Mechanical fasteners have three special attractions: they do not require heat; they can join dissimilar materials; and these can be of very different thickness. RIVETS are widely used in aircraft design - a testament to their strength, permanence and reliability. Riveting is done by inserting a stud with a head on one end through pre-drilled holes in the mating components, and clinching (squashing) the other end where it sticks out by hitting it with a shaped hammer. STAPLES - familiar as a way of binding paper and attaching leather and cloth to frames in furniture - are fast and cheap; they can also be used to assemble sheet metal. Staples are applied with a spring-loaded, electric or pneumatic jig that forces the staple through the materials and onto a grooved anvil, bending the legs inwards and pinching the materials together. In blind stapling there is no anvil - the legs of the staple are simply driven through one material into the other, where they stick in the same way that nails do."
Seweing,Joining,'Joining: Fasteners','',2004_sweing,-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html),"SEWING has been practiced for at least 5000 years - indeed, there is evidence that it is much older still. In sewing, a series of stitches are applied, using one or more continuous threads of fibers, to join two or more thicknesses of material. There are many types of stitching, broadly described as 'lock stitch' in which loops of one thread pass through the material and are locked on the other side by a second thread; or 'chain stitch' in which a single thread zigzags through the material. Sewing machines automate the process. The figure shows a chain stitch of a single lap joint."
Snap Fit,Joining,'Joining: Fasteners','',2005_snap_fit,-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html),"SNAP FITS, like other mechanical fastenings, involve no heat, they join dissimilar materials, they are fast andcheap and - if designed to do so - they can be disassembled. It is essential that the snap can tolerate the relativelylarge elastic deflection required for assembly or disassembly. Polymers, particularly, meet this requirement, thoughspringy metals, too, make good snap fits."

A digital micromirror device (array of mirrors, each corresponding to a single pixel, which may either be in the ON or OFF state) uses a UV laser to project a cross-section of the object into a bath of liquid photo-sensitive polymer. This cures an entire layer at once. When each layer is cured, the part is lowered on a platform into the bath to allow a new layer of liquid polymer to be wiped across the surface and the process repeated. Cleaning followed by post-production UV curing is required to completely solidify the prototype.

The uppermost layer of a bed of powdered material is loosely bonded through slight sintering by a scanned laser beam. A new layer of powder is then swept across the surface by a wiper or milling head and the process repeated, building the model layer by layer. Originally, the metal or ceramic powder would be coated in a polymer binder before being placed in an oven to vaporize the binder and sinter the remaining powder. When complete the very porous model is infiltrated with liquid bronze, which wets and is drawn into the porosity. This gives a fully dense product, with a complex external and internal shape (such as cooling channels) that can be used as a die for injection molding and die casting. There is now a variant of this process, Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), which uses a higher energy laser to directly melt the outside of the particles during formation to sinter in-situ without the use of a polymer binder. Parts produced in this way may also be infiltrated if a full density is required. Machining is often used after manufacture to reduce the surface roughness. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model is used to create an STL file that drives the scanning system."

The pattern is removed to leave the cavity in which the metal is poured. Cheap wooden patterns, with gates and risers attached, are used when the batch size is small and the process is manual, but this is slow and labor intensive. Automated systems use aluminum patterns and automated compaction. The sand mold is referred to as 'green' when it is used in a moist condition.

The most common equipment for molding thermoplastics is the reciprocating screw machine, shown schematically in the figure. Polymer granules are fed into a spiral press where they mix and soften to a dough-like consistency that can be forced through one or more channels ('sprues') into the die. The polymer solidifies under pressure and the component is then ejected. Thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers can all be injection molded.

The process blends, compounds, homogenizes and extrudes the polymer mix at temperatures between 135 and 370 C. The extrudate is cooled as it leaves the die, using air or water cooling; it may subsequently be 'drawn down' to a smaller cross-section. Variations of the process include film blowing, extrusion blow molding and filament forming. The process is used to coat wire, which can be achieved at high speeds. Extrusion is also used as a pre-process other molding processes such as injection molding, producing polymer blends in pellet form.The process has the advantage of relatively low tooling costs, though capital costs are high and the output usually requires further processing, varying from simply cutting to size to remelting and injection molding."

Carburizing and carbonitriding,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Heat Treatment','',2091_carburizing_carbonitriding,,"In CARBURISING, additional carbon is diffused into the surface of a low-carbon steel to give a high-carbon surface layer. When this is quenched, the layer transforms to a hard, brittle, martensite, which can subsequently be tempered to obtain the required balance of hardness and toughness. There are three broad classes of carburizing equipment; all require temperatures of about 900 C. The first uses a powder pack that releases carbon monoxide (CO); this decomposes on the surface of the steel to give atomic carbon and CO2. It is best for small parts. The second uses a fused salt bath containing sodium cyanide (NaCN>25%), barium chloride, sodium chloride and accelerators; it is very versatile and has a low capital cost. The last uses gas - methane, butane or pentane - as the source of carbon in a special muffle furnace that allows the gas to flow freely round the parts to be carburized; it lends itself to large-quantity production.CARBO-NITRIDING is a variant of gas carburizing in which ammonia (NH3) is added to the carburizing gas. Nitrogen, released from the ammonia, and carbon from the carburizing gas, diffuse into the component at the same time, precipitating nitrides as well as increasing the surface carbon content. It generally requires a lower temperature and shorter time than plain carburizing. The process produces a thinner layer, but one that retains its hardness to higher temperatures."
Induction and flame hardening,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Heat Treatment','',2092_induction_flame_hardening,,"The idea here is this: take a medium or high carbon steel -- cheap, easily formed and machined -- and flash its surface temperature up into the austenitic phase-region, from which it is rapidly cooled from a gas or liquid jet, giving a martensitic surface layer. The result is a tough body with a hard, wear and fatigue resistant, surface skin. Both processes allow the surface of carbon steels to be hardened with minimum distortion or oxidation. In INDUCTION HARDENING, a high frequency (up to 50kHz) electromagnetic field induces eddy-currents in the surface of the work-piece, locally heating it; the depth of hardening depends on the frequency. In FLAME HARDENING, heat is applied instead by high-temperature gas burners, followed, as before, by rapid cooling. Both processes are versatile and can be applied to work pieces that cannot readily be furnace treated or case hardened in the normal way."
Laser surface hardening and melting,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Heat Treatment','',2093_laser_surface_hardening_melting,,"Lasers are a clean, controllable heat source for surface treatment and welding (see also the record for laser welding). The laser beam scans the surface to cause a phase change for localized heat treatment, or to melt it for localized structure-change. This allows three sorts of process: surface transformation hardening, surface shocking, and surface melting and glazing. All can be applied to selected areas of the surface.In SURFACE TRANSFORMATION HARDENING (limited to carbon and alloy steels) the beam heats a spot on the surface to a temperature above that for the transmission to austenite. As the beam moves on, the hotspot is quenched by conduction of heat into the massive, cold interior of the component, transforming a thin surface layer to martensite. Single, separated tracks give a surface with good wear resistance - the alternating the hard and soft bands contribute to this. Overlapping tracks give a more uniform hardening of the entire surface.LASER SHOCK HARDENING uses a pulsed, high energy beam to violently vaporize a minute amount of surface material, creating a shock wave that locally deforms the underlying solid, while hardening it like shock peening.LASER SURFACE MELTING involves the use of a high intensity beam to scan the surface, protected by a shielding-gas, melting it. The subsequent rapid quench by conduction into the interior produces a track with a refined and homogenized microstructure. Laser glazing is a melting process carried out at a high processing speed such as the cooling rates between 10,000 and 1,000,000Â°C/sec can be achieved. At this cooling rate, metallic glass formation is possible if the alloy composition has a high glass-forming tendency."

The image is printed on a thin, water-soluble film; when floated on water, the image floats free and can be transferred to the product to which it sticks. CUBIC PRINTING uses the same principle, scaled-up and made commercially viable. The film and its image are floated on the surface of a water tank. The product is immersed in the tank, where the pressure of the water presses the image onto the surface of the component."
Electrophoretic and Autophoretic painting,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Painting and Printing','',2096_electrophoretic_autophoretic_painting,,"In ELECTRO-PAINTING the component forms the cathode in an electrolytic cell. The anode is inert - usually graphite or stainless steel, and the electrolyte is an aqueous solution in which the pigment is emulsified. An alkaline environment builds up at the cathode, causing the lacquer to coagulate. The charged particles of pigment are dragged by the field onto the surface of the component where they form a strongly bonded film. The film is relatively thin (13 - 15 microns), but gives good corrosion resistance, particularly if baked at 150 - 230 C after deposition. Other layers of paint are applied on top. The principle can be compared with electro-plating, and is widely used in the automobile industry."

Pad printing,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Painting and Printing','',2100_pad_printing,,"PAD PRINTING is a little like printing with rubber stamps; instead of rubber, the image is cut into a steel or copper plate, from which it is lifted by a rubber pad. It is used as a decorating process for irregular shapes, and for those shapes which cannot be easily printed by silk screen. The steps are as follows. (1) The image to be transferred is etched into a printing plate commonly referred to as a clicheÌÅ. The clicheÌÅ is flooded with ink and wiped, leaving ink only in the image area. As solvents evaporate from the image area the ink's ability to adhere the silicone transfer pad increases. (2) The pad is pressed onto the clicheÌÅ lifting the ink. Solvents evaporate from the outer ink layer where it is exposed to the atmosphere, making it tackier and more viscous. (3) The pad is pressed onto the component to be decorated, conforming to its shape and depositing the ink. Even though it compresses considerably during this step, the contoured pad is designed to roll away from the substrate surface without smudging the image by sliding. (4) When the pad is pressed onto the product, the adhesion between the ink and substrate is greater than the adhesion between the ink and pad, resulting in complete transfer of the ink, leaving the pad clean and ready for the next cycle. Automatic methods, with several pads in series (transfer pad printing), allow cheap multi-color decoration. Manual machines are used for low production volumes; for these, multi-color prints require separate steps and require set-up time."

Electro-polishing,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Polishing_Etching_Working_Texturing','',2105_electro_polishing,,"ELECTRO-POLISHING is electro-plating in reverse. It offers an escape from the high cost of mechanical polishing, but at the penalty of much lower precision. The component is connected to the positive side of a low voltage direct current power source while a cathode is connected to the negative side, both immersed in a conductive solution. During the process, a layer of oxides or salts forms on the surface of the component; the layer controls the dissolution so that high points of a rough surface are dissolved faster than lower points. The final result is a metal surface with a smooth glossy appearance."
Etching,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Polishing_Etching_Working_Texturing','',2106_etching,,"There are three basic processes for etching. CHEMICAL ETCHING, a method that is widely used to decorate to glass, metal and polymer objects. The areas or patterns to be etched are exposed to an acid; the areas that are not to be etched are protected with a wax resist. Glass used to be etched by hydrofluoric acid, a particularly nasty chemical that gives off poisonous fumes; today this has largely been replaced by proprietary etch-gels, by sand etching or by engraving with a diamond tool. Copper, zinc, nickel and steel are etched in various combinations of sulfuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids. These, too, create environmental problems. SAND ETCHING makes use of a jet of angular sand particles in a pressurized gas stream to erode the surface where it is not protected by a mask. The rate of etching and the fineness of the finish depend on the air pressure and sand particles size. The method also works well with polymers. ELECTRO-ETCHING is a non-toxic way of etching of metals. Here the acid bath is replaced by one of copper sulfate (for etching copper) or zinc sulfate (for etching zinc) that never has to be changed. The object, protected by wax resists where necessary, is made the anode (+) of an electro-polishing bath, cutting into the areas of surface not protected by the resist."

There are many variants, among them: lapping, honing and polishing. All make use of a fine abrasive, suspended in wax, oil or some other fluid, that is rubbed against the surface to be polished by a polishing disk, a belt or a shaped former.GRINDING is a cruder process, but still one that allows precision in dimensioning and finishing a surface. It works best on hard surfaces; soft surfaces smear and contaminate ('glaze') the grinding wheel."

By CASTING or MOLDING in a patterned tool; but the draft angle must be increased with the depth of texture. By ROLLING between patterned rolls. 'Diamond plate', used for stair treads, is made in this way. By CRIMPING, pressing of sheet between patterned dies. Pre-plated sheet, up to 0.8mm thick, can be crimped to give sparkling reflective patterns; it is used, too, to increase bending stiffness and strength, allowing lighter gauge material for boxes and cans. By SAND BLASTING, or abrasive polishing, the microscopic roughening of the surface in a random or patterned way (as in 'brushed aluminum'). By LASER TEXTURING, usually applied to rolls or dies; the pulsed laser beam creates minute craters on the roll surface in a precisely controlled pattern that is then transferred to the component during the rolling operation.

Anodizing,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Surface Coating','',2109_anodizing,,"Aluminum is a reactive metal, yet in everyday objects it does not corrode or discolor. That is because of a thin oxide film - Al2O3 - that forms spontaneously on its surface, and this film, though invisible, is highly protective. The film can be thickened and its structure controlled by the process of ANODISING. The process is electrolytic; the electrolyte, typically, is dilute (15%) sulfuric acid. The object to be anodized is made the anode (+) of the bath, with a potential difference of a few volts between it and the inert cathode. This sets up an enormous potential gradient across the oxide film, causing it to grow in thickness. The thicker film gives greater protection, and can be colored or patterned."
Electroless plating,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Surface Coating','',2110_electroless_plating,,"ELECTRO-LESS PLATING (alias autocatalytic plating) is electro-plating without electricity. It relies instead on a difference in what is called electropotential when a metal is placed in a solution containing ions of another metal. Metal ions from the solution are deposited on the catalytic surface of the component by the action of a chemical reducing agent present in a metallic salt solution. In the case of electro-less plating of nickel (the most significant commercial application of the process), the salt is nickel chloride and the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphate. Once started the reaction can continue and there is no theoretical limit to the thickness of the coating. Electro-less plating is used when it is impossible or impractical to use normal electroplating - when complex internal surfaces are to be plated, or when dimensional accuracy of the component is critical, for instance."

The gas stream accelerates them to 90 to 25 m/s and propels them towards the surface at a distance 100 to 250 mm from the gun. The molten particles strike the surface and flow into thin, flat droplets that overlap, interlock and bond as they solidify. Multiple passes allow thick coatings to be built up."
Polymer powder coating,Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Surface Coating','',2114_polymer_powder_coating,,"ELECTROSTATIC POWDER COATING is an efficient, widely used process for applying decorative and protective finishes to metallic or conducting components. The powder is a mixture of finely ground pigment and resin that is sprayed through a negatively charged nozzle onto a surface to be coated. The charged powder particles adhere to the surface of the electrically grounded component. The charge difference attracts the powder to the component at places where the powder layer (which is insulating) is thinnest, building up a uniform layer and minimizing powder loss. The component is subsequently heated to fuse the layer into a smooth coating in a curing oven. The result is a uniform, durable coating of high quality and attractive finish. Powder coating is the fastest growing finishing technology in North America, representing over 10% of all industrial finishing. In polymer flame coating, a thermoplastic in powder form (80-200 Î_m) is fed from a hopper into a gas-air flame that melts the powder and propels it onto the surface to be coated. The process is versatile, can be mechanized or operated manually, and can build up coatings as thick as 1 mm. A wide range of thermoplastic powders can be used and the process is cheap. The disadvantages: line-of-sight deposition, and surface finish that is inferior to other processes.In FLUIDISED BED COATING the component, heated to 200 - 400 C, is immersed for 1 to 10 seconds in a tank containing coating powder, fluidized by a stream of air at 0.1 - 0.5 atmospheres. The hot component melts the particles, which adhere to it, forming a thick coating with excellent adhesion."
Vapor metallizing (PVD),Surface Treatment,'Surface Treatment: Surface Coating','',2115_vapor_metallizing,-- Machineshop (http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/mshop/machines.html),"Mirrors used to be made by a complex process involving silver dissolved in mercury. Today they are made by PVD METALLIZING, a process in which a thin coating of metal - usually aluminum - is deposited from a vapor onto a component. The vapor is created in a vacuum chamber by direct heating or electron beam heating of the metal, from which it condenses onto the cold component, much like steam from a hot bath condensing on a bathroom mirror. In PVD metallizing there is no potential difference between bath and component. In ION PLATING the vapor is ionized and accelerated by an electric field (the component is the cathode, and the metallizing source material is the anode). In sputtering, argon ions are accelerated by the electric field onto a metal target, ejecting metal ions onto the component surface. By introducing a reactive gas, compounds can be formed (Ti sputtering in an atmosphere of N2, to give a hard coating of TiN, for instance)."
