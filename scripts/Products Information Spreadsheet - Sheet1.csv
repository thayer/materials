Add these to your daily cleaning supplies.","Natural rubber: Latex, the sap of the rubber tree, is cross-linked (vulcanized) by heating with sulfur; the amount of the cross-linking determines the properties.

Each Squish product independently maintains its shape when in use and thoughtfully-designed features anticipate the needs of the most exacting home chefs.

Clever features like gently curved rims, thoughtfully-placed pour spouts, smooth sides and non-slip grips for bases and handles make the Squish collection a valuable ally for any home chef. Each product performs as well as its non-collapsible counterpart, yet stores efficiently in a fraction of the space. FDA-approved materials are safe for food items and dishwasher friendly.

Natural sea sponges are easy to care for. Just wqueeze out the water and keep in a dry place in your bathroom. Sponge will air dry completely and is naturally resistant to bacterial growth. If, for some reason, your sponge needs freshening, you can soak for 24 hours in a very mild bleach solution (1 tsp. per gallon). Natural sea sponges have been used for bathing since the days of the Roman Empire. Our natural sea sponges are harvested by hand in the shallow waters of the Culf of Mexico.
