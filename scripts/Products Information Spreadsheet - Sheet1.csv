Crafted using an exclusive design technique that marries flexibility with rigidity, Squish brings as much joy in use as it does stored away. Playful, vibrant and versatile, the sturdy construction does not sacrifice performance for collapsibility. Each Squish product independently maintains its shape when in use and thoughtfully-designed features anticipate the needs of the most exacting home chefs. Each graduated layer of a Squish item 'snaps' into place to perform its desired function with confidence whether storing flat or expanding for use. Clever features like gently curved rims, thoughtfully-placed pour spouts, smooth sides and non-slip grips for bases and handles make the Squish collection a valuable ally for any home chef. Each product performs as well as its non-collapsible counterpart, yet stores efficiently in a fraction of the space. FDA-approved materials are safe for food items and dishwasher friendly. With an assortment of essential items that set free an entire kitchen cupboard, Squish makes today's storage challenges disappear in one second flat.

Natural sea sponges are easy to care for. Just wqueeze out the water and keep in a dry place in your bathroom. Sponge will air dry completely and is naturally resistant to bacterial growth. If, for some reason, your sponge needs freshening, you can soak for 24 hours in a very mild bleach solution (1 tsp. per gallon). Natural sea sponges have been used for bathing since the days of the Roman Empire. Our natural sea sponges are harvested by hand in the shallow waters of the Culf of Mexico.

Dishes are stacked high and you know for sure that not one guest washed their plate off. That means you get to stick your hands in the dirty dishes and endure the various different textures of soaked food. However, there’s a way to keep your hands clean while you clean up the dishes. This pair of gloves is made of 100% natural latex with a sprinkled cotton inside, keeping your hands clean and dry while your dishes get all the suds. The design covers up to your wrists so nothing can get in. With the impenetrable texture, use this to protect yourself while cleaning around the house and using potentially harmful chemicals. Add these to your daily cleaning supplies.","Natural rubber: Latex, the sap of the rubber tree, is cross-linked (vulcanized) by heating with sulfur; the amount of the cross-linking determines the properties. It is the most widely used of all elastomers - more than 50% of all produced
Cotton: A soft fluffy usually white material made up of twisted hairs that surrounds the seeds of a tall plant of warm regions and is spun into thread or yarn

Dip forming: Dipping a hand-shaped ceramic former into the rubber
Vulcanization: To dry the rubber without cracking it
Cuff beading: Rolling the cuffs to make the gloves easier to remove
Cotton powder coating: Dusting inside of gloves with cotton
