Dishes are stacked high and you know for sure that not one guest washed their plate off.

The design covers up to your wrists so nothing can get in. With the impenetrable texture, use this to protect yourself while cleaning around the house and using potentially harmful chemicals. Add these to your daily cleaning supplies.","Natural rubber: Latex, the sap of the rubber tree, is cross-linked (vulcanized) by heating with sulfur; the amount of the cross-linking determines the properties.

Crafted using an exclusive design technique that marries flexibility with rigidity, Squish brings as much joy in use as it does stored away. Playful, vibrant and versatile, the sturdy construction does not sacrifice performance for collapsibility. Each Squish product independently maintains its shape when in use and thoughtfully-designed features anticipate the needs of the most exacting home chefs. Each graduated layer of a Squish item 'snaps' into place to perform its desired function with confidence whether storing flat or expanding for use. Clever features like gently curved rims, thoughtfully-placed pour spouts, smooth sides and non-slip grips for bases and handles make the Squish collection a valuable ally for any home chef. Each product performs as well as its non-collapsible counterpart, yet stores efficiently in a fraction of the space. FDA-approved materials are safe for food items and dishwasher friendly. With an assortment of essential items that set free an entire kitchen cupboard, Squish makes today's storage challenges disappear in one second flat.
