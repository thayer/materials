If a bar of soap with a rough surface is immersed in water, it emerges smoother than it went it. That is because the soap dissolves faster at the peaks of the roughness than at the troughs because the local concentration gradient is steeper there. CHEMICAL POLISHING relies on a similar principle. It is a process whereby a surface is smoothed by controlled chemical dissolution in a bath of acid containing additives that, by creating a surface boundary-layer, cause protrusions to dissolve faster than flat or intruded components of the surface - there is no external power supply. The process is normally carried out at high temperatures to increase the polishing rate. Chemical polishing, like electro-polishing, is a way of brightening a surface, enhancing reflectivity, but without the dimensional precision of mechanical polishing. Much cheaper, of course.
