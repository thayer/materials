In ELECTRO-DISCHARGE MACHINING (EDM) the work-piece is held in a jig submerged in a dielectric fluid such as kerosene. A power supply generates rapid electric pulses that create a discharge between the work piece and an electrode (a shaped graphite form) at the point of which the two are closest. The discharge creates a plasma causing the melting (and probably the vaporization) of a minute bite of material, slowly eating into the work piece; the debris is swept away by the dielectric fluid. EDM is remarkable for its ability to shape difficult materials, provided they are conductors, and do so with great precision.
