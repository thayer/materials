IN-MOLD DECORATION (IMD) allows accurately registered colors, designs and print to be applied to injection molded components without any secondary processing. The image, which can be full-color, is printed onto a polyester or polycarbonate film is called the 'foil'. If the product is flat or mildly curved, the foil is fed as a continuous strip, or cut and placed directly, in the mold. If true 3D components are to be made, the foil is first thermally molded to the shape of the component, then placed in the mold cavity. Hot liquid resin is injected behind the foil, bonding its surface to the molding resin and forming a integrally decorated component.
