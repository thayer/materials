GRINDING includes a group of processes that are used to shape materials that are too hard to be machined by conventional methods, and to improve precision and surface finish. The workpiece is held by a mechanical or magnetic grip that can be tracked or rotated beneath the grinding wheel (if small) or held stationary beneath the moving wheel (if large) while unwanted material is removed using an abrasive grinding wheel. Grinding works best on hard surfaces; soft metals smear and contaminate ("glaze") the wheel. Grinding processes are expensive and should be used only when absolutely necessary.
