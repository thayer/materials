SOLDERING with lead-tin alloys has been practiced for at least 3000 years. It uses alloys that melt below 450 Â°C. It can be thought of as low-temperature brazing, or - another analogy - as gluing with metal. Soldered joints are
less strong than brazed joints - more like an adhesive - but the equipment needed to make them is simpler and the temperatures reached by the component are much lower, an essential for the assembly of electronic equipment. Soldering can be applied in the same way as braze, or - more like an adhesive - by pre-coating ('tinning') the metal surfaces to be joined before assembling and simply heating them with a torch, an electric soldering iron, or an array of infra-red lamps. In RE-FLOW SOLDERING, the components are heated by vapor from a boiling fluorinated hydrocarbon that condenses on components, releasing latent heat, and giving rapid, uniform heating. There are pressures to replace lead-based solders because of the potential toxicity of heavy metals, but viable alternatives are not yet widely available.
