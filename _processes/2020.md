HOT GAS WELDING is a way of joining thermoplastics that is similar, in many ways, to the gas welding of metals. The weld torch is just a souped-up hairdryer that directs a stream of hot gas, at scalp-searing temperatures (200-300 oC) at the joint area and at a rod of the same thermoplastic as the substrate. Polymers are very viscous when heated, so they do not flow in the way that metals do - that is why filler material is needed; the filler is pressed into the softened joint to form the bond. The process is slow and poorly adapted for mass production, but it is easily portable, making it the best way to assemble and repair large polymer components.
