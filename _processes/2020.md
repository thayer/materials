description: "The simplest of all welding processes for polymers is the one that you can use in your kitchen to seal food into freezer-bags: HOT BAR WELDING. In this process, overlapping thermoplastic polymer films are pinched between electrically heated, PTFE coated, bars. One bar is hinged to allow the films to be inserted and removed. Mechanical or pneumatic actuators close the bar and exert the pinch force. The joint itself is heated by conduction though the film, limiting the film thickness to less than 0.5mm. A typical weld in a 100 micron thermoplastic film takes 1 - 3 seconds. Impulse welding is a modification of hot bar welding in which the bars are pulse-heated, giving an additional control of quality."
