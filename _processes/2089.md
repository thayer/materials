In HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING a powder is sealed in a deformable metal container (the 'can') and then subjected to a high temperature at high pressure (1100C, 200MPa) in a pressure vessel, inside which there is a furnace surrounding the container in which the powder is loaded. Argon is used as the pressurizing medium. In the 'SINTER-HIP' process, a variation of HIPing, the initial sintering of the compacts and their subsequent densification are done sequentially in the same vessel. The main advantage of HIPing is its ability to produce components which are 100% dense and having uniform isotropic properties, but it is expensive, limiting its use to those applications in which the integrity of the material is of prime importance (e.g. turbine disks and blades).
