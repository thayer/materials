description: "In FILAMENT WINDING, axisymmetric parts are produced by winding the resin-impregnated reinforcement (rovings or tape) on a rotating mandrel made of steel or plaster. The winding pattern -- helical, hoop or polar -- is chosen to maximized the performance of the application. A multi-axis winding spindle is used for winding more complex shapes. Winding is continued until the desired material thickness has been achieved. The component is pulled off the mandrel as soon as it has hardened. The high volume fraction of continuous reinforcement results in products with high strengths."
