In EVAPORATIVE PATTERN CASTING, a pattern is made of polystyrene foam and is coated with a refractory coating. It is then embedded in dry unbonded sand which is vibrated to produce a rigid mold.
The polystyrene pattern is vaporized when the mold is filled with molten metal. Patterns are made by machining blocks of expanded polystyrene. Because the pattern does not have to be removed, very complex shapes with undercuts and re-entrant angles are feasible.

Cores are eliminated and no sand binders are needed.
