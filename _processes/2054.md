SMC MOLDING is one of the most economical processes for the high volume production of small-to-medium panels. Sheet molding compound (SMC) is premix of resin, chopped reinforcement, catalyst (if any) and additives. The process uses an accurate matched metal mold which is placed in a heated press. The sheet is first cut to a shape similar to the mold to minimize the distance the mix has to flow to fill the mold. . The mold is then closed and pressure (3-7 MPa) and heat are applied to form and cure the panel.
