When we get "down to the nuts and bolts" we are getting down to basics. Screws are as old as engineering - the olive press of roman times relied on a gigantic wooden screw. THREADED FASTENERS are the most versatile of mechanical fasteners, with all the advantages they offer: they do not involve heat, they can join dissimilar materials of very different thickness and they can be disassembled. Ordinary screws require a pre-threaded hole or a nut; self-tapping screws cut their own thread.
