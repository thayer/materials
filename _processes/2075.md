In LASER CUTTING a focused beam of monochromatic light (the laser beam) is focused on the workpiece, creating a plasma and local melting. Shielding gas can be blown through a nozzle in the laser unit to protect the surface, though in cutting thick metal plate use is made of the exothermic oxidation of the material in the cut. The equipment is expensive, though not quite as costly as that for electron-beam processing. High volume or critical welding conditions are required to justify the necessary investment. Because laser cutting does not require a vacuum chamber, it has taken over many applications from e-beam cutting, particularly in the micro-electronics field.
