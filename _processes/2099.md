In ORGANIC-SOLVENT BASED PAINTING, the coloring materials (pigments) are suspended, together with the binding agents (resins), in a volatile organic solvent (VOC). When spread thin over a surface, the solvent evaporates; the resins hold the pigments in place to form a decorative and protective coating. Some few paints are not much more than this today. Watching paint dry is a synonym for boredom. But modern paints are far from boring. New developments now give formulations that dry in seconds, have fade-resistant colors, soft textures, visual effects, powerful protective qualities, and much more. But there is a problem. Solvent-based paints are environmentally bad, so bad that their very future is under threat.
