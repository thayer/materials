In VACUUM/PRESSURE BAG MOLDING reinforcement is layed-up on the mold and resin is applied by conventional hand or spray lay-up techniques. The laminate is then sealed beneath a rubber membrane and the air pumped. Atmospheric pressure or a pumped pressure applies a uniform compression across its surface. The single-part mold, made of epoxy, GRFP or metal, is relatively cheap. The use of vacuum or pressure bags gives high quality, dense products.
