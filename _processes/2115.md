Mirrors used to be made by a complex process involving silver dissolved in mercury. Today they are made by PVD METALLIZING, a process in which a thin coating of metal - usually aluminum - is deposited from a vapor onto a component. The vapor is created in a vacuum chamber by direct heating or electron beam heating of the metal, from which it condenses onto the cold component, much like steam from a hot bath condensing on a bathroom mirror. In PVD metallizing there is no potential difference between bath and component. In ION PLATING the vapor is ionized and accelerated by an electric field (the component is the cathode, and the metallizing source material is the anode). In sputtering, argon ions are accelerated by the electric field onto a metal target, ejecting metal ions onto the component surface. By introducing a reactive gas, compounds can be formed (Ti sputtering in an atmosphere of N2, to give a hard coating of TiN, for instance).
