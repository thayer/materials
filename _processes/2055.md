description: "The process of squeezing toothpaste from its tube is one of extrusion. The gooey toothpaste - or the gooey polymer or metal in the industrial process - is forced by pressure to flow through a shaped die, taking up the profile of the die orifice. In co-extrusion two materials are extruded at the same time and bond together - a trick used in toothpaste to create colored stripes in it."
