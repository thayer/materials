STAMPING is a generic term for a range of sheet-forming processes involving dies and press. They include blanking, shearing, drawing, bending, forming and coining, performed singly or consecutively to form complex shapes with a uniform cross-sectional thickness. Progressive dies allow a number of operations at the same station giving high production rates. Tools are dedicated, so tooling costs are high. Stamping is limited to materials available in sheet form.
