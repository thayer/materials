description: "SPINNING involves the forming of axisymmetric parts over a rotating mandrel by a rigid tool or roller. The process uses a lathe-type machine in which is mounted a forming block against which the metal sheet is pressed as it and the forming block rotate. The sheet gradually takes the shape of the forming block. The tools, made of wood or steel, are very simple and thus cheap, making the process attractive for small production runs. Most spinning is performed at room temperature though, if required, it can be done hot."
