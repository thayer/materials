Hot dipping is a process for coating a metal, mainly ferrous metals, with low melting point metals usually zinc and its alloys. The component is first degreased in a caustic bath, then pickled (to remove rust and scale) in a sulfuric acid bath, immersed (dipped) in the liquid metal and, after lifting out, it is cooled in a cold air stream. The molten metal alloys with the surface of the component, forming a continuous thin coating. When the coating is zinc and the component is steel, the process is known as Galvanizing.


The process is very versatile and can be applied to components of any shape, and sizes up to 30 m x 2 m x 4 m. The cost is comparable with that of painting, but the protection offered by galvanizing is much greater, because if the coating is scratched it is the zinc not the underlying steel that corrodes ("galvanic protection"). Properly galvanized steel will survive outdoors for 30-40 years without further treatment.
