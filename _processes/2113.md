description: "Wire flame spraying is one of a family of processes for spraying metal - others are arc wire thermal spraying, plasma arc spraying, and powder flame spraying. All use a heat source to melt the coating material and a high velocity gas jet to break it into small droplets and propel them to the surface to be coated.
 
 
 In wire flame spraying, a continuous wire or rod is fed into an oxyacetylene flame, which melts it and disperses it into droplets 10 to 100 microns in diameter. The gas stream accelerates them to 90 to 25 m/s and propels them towards the surface at a distance 100 to 250 mm from the gun. The molten particles strike the surface and flow into thin, flat droplets that overlap, interlock and bond as they solidify. Multiple passes allow thick coatings to be built up."
