DRILLING uses a rotary end cutting tool with one or more cutting lips and usually one or more flutes for the passage of chips and the admission of cutting fluid. Drilling is the fastest and most economical method of cutting a hole in solid metal. Shaped drills allow stepped holes and countersinking. Almost any material can be drilled; glass, stone and ceramic require drills with tungsten carbide or diamond tips.
