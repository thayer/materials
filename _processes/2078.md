description: "In COMPRESSION MOLDING a pre-measured quantity of polymer - usually a thermoset - in the form of granules or a pre-formed tablet containing resin and hardener is placed in a heated mold. The mold is closed creating sufficient pressure to force the polymer into the mold cavity. The polymer is allowed to cure, the mold is opened and the component removed. A variant, polymer forging, is used to form thermoplastics that are difficult to mold, such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, or shapes that have thick walls or large and abrupt changes in section area. Compression molding is widely used to shape the composites BMC and SMC. BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) and SMC (Sheet Molding Compound) differ in the shape and content of reinforcement and filler. BMC has less (15-25% of glass fiber) and it is the easiest to mold to 3-dimensional shapes. SMC has more (up to 35%) of glass fiber and is limited to sheet shapes. DMC (Dough Molding Compound) is the genesis - a dough-like mix of thermosetting polyester, polyurethane or epoxy with hardener, chopped glass fiber, filler and coloring agent. Two more - GMT (Glass Mat Thermoplastics) and TSC (Thermoplastic Sheet Compounds) - are the thermoplastic equivalent, based on nylon 6 or polypropylene. The word 'dough' conveys well the way in which they are shaped: squeezed between a pair of dies, like a pie crust."
