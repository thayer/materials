If you want to weld using ultrasound, you need an ultrasonic generator, a converter (transducer), a booster and a welding tool, bizarrely called a sonotrode. The generator for ULTRASONIC WELDING converts 50 Hz mains voltage into a 20 kHz signal. The converter uses the reverse piezoelectric effect to transform the 20 kHz AC signal into mechanical oscillations. The booster and the sonotrode transmit this to the weld zone in such a way to create an oscillating displacement of 10 to 30 microns. A static pressure of 2-15 MPa is applied across the surfaces to be joined and the power switched on to make them slide, heat, roughen and bond.
