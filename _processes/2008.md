In FRICTION-STIR WELDING a non-consumable, rapidly rotating, tool is pushed onto the materials to be welded. The central pin and shoulder contact the two parts to be joined, generating frictional heat that plasticizes the material. As the tool is made to traverse the joint line, material from its front is swept around to the rear, creating an intimate bond.

The weld quality is excellent, and the process is environmentally friendly. No melting takes place so volume changes caused by solidification are avoided; residual stress and distortion are low. The process is at present used to weld aluminum, magnesium, zinc and lead alloys, but developments to allow welding of copper, titanium and steel are expected. Joints between dissimilar metals (e.g. Mg alloys to Al alloys) and between metal-matrix composites are practical.
