description: "The CERAMIC SHELL EVAPORATIVE MOLD (REPLICAST) process combines the advantages of investment casting and the EPC (evaporative pattern) processes. An expanded polystyrene pattern is made as in the EPC process and then is coated with a ceramic layer as in investment casting. The mold assembly is fired at 1000C which burns off the pattern and produces an inert shell, which is supported in a sand bed during casting. The use of expanded polystyrene for the pattern enables large, light weight patterns to be produced. The process gives many of the benefits of investment casting -- especially surface finish and tolerances --and extends the size range for investment casting."
