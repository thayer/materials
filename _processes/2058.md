In ROTARY SWAGING (or RADIAL FORGING) a rod, wire or tube is reduced in diameter by the reciprocating radial movement of one or two pairs of opposed dies. The dies are shaped to give the required external shape. A mandrel may be used with thin-walled tubes and to give internal shape. Normally the dies are rotated around the workpiece as they reciprocate radially. The 'stationary die swaging' process is a variant in which bot spindle and dies do not rotate, allowing non-round external cross-sections to be formed. Good mechanical properties, surface finish and tolerances are achieved. Typical final diameters range from 0.5 mm to 150 mm, but swages capable of handling up to 350 mm diameter tubing have been produced.
