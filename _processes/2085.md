REACTION INJECTION MOLDING (RIM) is a low pressure (0.35 - 0.7 MPa) process used for the in-situ polymerization of parts. It uses preheated low-viscosity chemicals (e.g. polyol + isocyanate for PUR).
These are fed under pressure to the mixing head, from which they are injected into the mold where polymerization occurs. The process is generally used for large parts that can have complex shapes.
It is most commonly used with thermosetting polyurethane (PUR) but other polymers are also used (e.g. nylon 6, epoxy resins, etc). The process can be adapted to produce fiber-reinforced composites (reinforced RIM - RRIM) and structural foam products (by incorporating a blowing agent). Structural foam parts produced by this technique have a dense skin and a foamed core due to cooling at the mold wall.
