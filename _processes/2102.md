ENAMELLING is painting with glass. The enameled masks of the Pharaohs of Egypt look as bright, vibrant and perfect today as they did when they were created over 3000 years ago (Tutankhamen, BC 1358 - 1340). A thin layer of glass powder with binder and coloring agent is applied to the object to be enameled by painting or screen printing; the layer is then fused to the object, generally made of cast iron, pressed steel, copper, silver or even - in the case of Tutankhamen - of gold, creating a continuous, strongly-bonded coating of colored glass. It is a hot process - the object being enameled must be heated to the melting temperature of the glass powder - limiting it to use on metals and ceramics.
