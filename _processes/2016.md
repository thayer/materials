description: "OXYACETYLENE WELDING is the oldest of all welding processes. An oxyacetylene weld is produced by heating with a flame obtained from the combustion of oxygen and acetylene. Three types of flames can be obtained: reducing, neutral and oxidizing flames. The neutral one (equal proportions of oxygen and acetylene) is the most widely used. The reducing flame has excess acetylene and is used in welding Monel metal, nickel, certain alloy steels and non-ferrous metals. An oxidizing flame (with excess oxygen) is used for welding brass and bronze. Oxyacetylene welding has been replaced in many applications by arc welding."
