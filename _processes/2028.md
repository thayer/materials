LASER POWDER FORMING (LPF) is an additive manufacturing technique in which wire or powder is fed into a melt pool created by a laser. The laser is scanned across the surface to add material to one layer at a time. When used as an alternative to machining from a block, a simple geometry is printed which requires milling to give the desired finish. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is used to create the code to guide the laser.

The process is also known as blown powder additive manufacturing, laser beam metal deposition, directed light fabrication, 3D laser cladding, laser generation, laser-based metal deposition, laser freeform fabrication, laser direct casting, laser consolidation or direct metal deposition. A variation on this method is wire fed plasma arc.
