description: "The chunky, brightly-colored chairs for children are examples of what can be done with ROTATIONAL MOLDING. First a pre-measured quantity of polymer powder is fed into a cold die, which is then heated in a large oven while it is rotated about two axes simultaneously. This tumbles and melts the powder, coating the inside walls of the mold to a thickness set by the initial load of powder, creating a hollow shell. The component then cools in a dwell cycle, the mold chilled by air or water spray. The process is best suited for components that are large, hollow and closed; although small, thin-walled components can be made and open shapes can be created by subsequent machining."
