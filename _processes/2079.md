The snow-white, crisp, light protective packaging in which your computer arrived, and which you discarded, oblivious of its visual aesthetics, was made by EXPANDED FOAM MOLDING of polystyrene. It is a low temperature, low pressure, process using cheap mold materials, with uses far beyond those of throwaway packaging. There are two stages in its operation. Solid polymer granules, colored, if desired, containing a foaming agent that releases CO2 on heating (a commodity product, widely available) are first softened and expanded by steam-heating under a small pressure. The softened particles are transferred to aluminum molds (to give good heat transfer) and steam-heated at 3 atmospheres, causing them to expand to 20 or more times their original volume and fuse together, filling the mold and taking up its shape.
