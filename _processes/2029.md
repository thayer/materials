MASK PROJECTION STEREOLITHOGRAPHY (MPSLA) is an additive manufacturing technique similar to Stereolithography (SLA), but it builds up objects layer-by-layer. A digital micromirror device (array of mirrors, each corresponding to a single pixel, which may either be in the ON or OFF state) uses a UV laser to project a cross-section of the object into a bath of liquid photo-sensitive polymer. This cures an entire layer at once. When each layer is cured, the part is lowered on a platform into the bath to allow a new layer of liquid polymer to be wiped across the surface and the process repeated. Cleaning followed by post-production UV curing is required to completely solidify the prototype. Fabricating a part using this method requires a CAD model, from which the cross-sections are derived.

The process is also known as Digital Light Processing (DLP) and is the closest alternative to solid ground curing which is now obsolete.
