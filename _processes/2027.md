FUSED DEPOSITION MODELLING (FDM) is an additive manufacturing technique suitable for use in an office environment. A fine stream of molten material (usually thermoplastic) is deposited by a two-axis heated extrusion head. Semi-liquid thermoplastic material is extruded and then deposited one layer at a time starting at the base. This builds the model vertically on a fixtureless base. Successive layers adhere together through thermal fusion. The FDM process requires no post-production UV curing, enabling multiple versions of a part to be created within a short time frame. This is the most widely used additive manufacturing method for home and office use due to the low machine and operating costs. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required.
