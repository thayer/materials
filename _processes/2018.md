The tungsten filament of a light bulb is heated, by resistance, to about 2000 C. That is more than enough to melt most metals. RESISTANCE WELDING relies on localizing the electric current I (and thus the "I-squared R" heating) where heating is desired: at the interface. In RESISTANCE SPOT WELDING, the overlapping sheets are pressed between water cooled electrodes. The current-pulse generates heat; the cooled electrodes chill the surfaces, localizing the heat in the interface between the sheets where the metal melts and welds. PROJECTION SPOT WELDING uses an additional trick - a pre-formed pimple on the face of the joint - to confine the current path and further localize the heating; a clever idea, because it extends the use of the method to forgings, castings and machined components and makes it faster because several welds can be made at the same time. In SEAM RESISTANCE WELDING the electrodes are water-cooled wheels, between which overlapping sheets are rolled to give a seam weld.
