Transfers are familiar to every child - a painless way of applying images to paper, to products and even to yourself. The image is printed on a thin, water-soluble film; when floated on water, the image floats free and can be transferred to the product to which it sticks. CUBIC PRINTING uses the same principle, scaled-up and made commercially viable. The film and its image are floated on the surface of a water tank. The product is immersed in the tank, where the pressure of the water presses the image onto the surface of the component.
