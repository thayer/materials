MANUAL or SHIELDED METAL ARC WELDING (MMA or SMA), also known as TORCH WELDING, is the most important general purpose welding and surfacing method using low cost equipment. In it, an electric arc is established between a flux-coated consumable rod (an electrode) and the component. The flux coating decomposes to give a gas shield; the slag that forms over the weld-pool prevents the metal from oxidizing. Appropriate choice of metal and flux allow the process to be used for a wide variety of applications, though they are almost exclusively limited to ferrous alloys. MMA equipment is portable, and the process is very flexible but, being manual, requires high operator skill.
