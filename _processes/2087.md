In POWDER INJECTION MOLDING and POWDER EXTRUSION, metal or ceramic powder is mixed with a thermoplastic binder (up to 50%) and injected under pressure into heated molds on standard injection molding machines. Most of the binder is removed from the molded components by thermal baking or solvent processing. The green parts are then sintered to near full density. The mechanical properties are generally better than those of traditional P/M parts and can approach those of wrought metal of the same composition.
