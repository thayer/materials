description: "In ELECTRO-PAINTING the component forms the cathode in an electrolytic cell. The anode is inert - usually graphite or stainless steel, and the electrolyte is an aqueous solution in which the pigment is emulsified. An alkaline environment builds up at the cathode, causing the lacquer to coagulate. The charged particles of pigment are dragged by the field onto the surface of the component where they form a strongly bonded film. The film is relatively thin (13 - 15 microns), but gives good corrosion resistance, particularly if baked at 150 - 230 C after deposition. Other layers of paint are applied on top. The principle can be compared with electro-plating, and is widely used in the automobile industry.
 
 
 In AUTOPHORETIC PAINTING the component is submerged in a bath of emulsified pigment. Ion exchange between the component and the solution causes the charged particle of paint to be attracted to the component where they merge to form a continuous film."
