SELECTIVE LASER SINTERING (SLS) is an additive manufacturing technique that operates on the same principles as stereolithography, but uses a fine, heat-fusible powder (a thermoplastic or wax), which is fused together by a scanned laser beam to build the model. A new layer of powder is then swept across the surface by a wiper or milling head and the process repeated, building the model layer-by-layer. The surface is stepped due to the layers so it requires machining after manufacture to reduce the roughness. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model is used to create and STL file that drives the scanning system.

The process is also known as laser sintering.
