HOT STAMPING is a dry process for permanently applying a colored design, logo, text or image. It is best known as a method of applying metallic gold or silver lettering or decoration. A heated metal die (250-300 C) is pressed against a colored carrier foil and the component being printed. The hot stamp is created when the raised surface of the die contacts the foil and transfers the colored film on the face of the foil to the product being printed. The pressure from the die creates a recess for marking, which protects the stamped letter from abrasion, and heat makes the marking medium adhere to the product.
