SILK SCREEN PRINTING has its origins in Japanese stenciling, but the process that we know today stems from patents taken out by Samuel Simon of Manchester at the turn of the century. He used silk stretched on frames to support hand painted stencils, a process also used by William Morris to create his famous wallpapers and textile prints. During the First World War in America screen printing took off as an industrial printing process; but it was the invention of the photographic stencil in the 1930s that revolutionized the process. It is now a $5 billion per year industry.
