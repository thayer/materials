In BINDER PRINTING, a multi-jet print head, like that of a bubble-jet printer, deposits droplets (80 microns in diameter) of binder onto a powder bed. After each sweep of the print head a new, thin layer of powder is spread across the surface of the model, so that on the next sweep of the print head a new layer of bonded powder is created. The final model is then shaken and blasted with pressurized air to remove excess powder. When used to make green compacts from ceramics the polymer must be burnt off before sintering. A wide variety of powder and binder combinations are possible. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required.
