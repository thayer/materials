ELECTRO-LESS PLATING (alias autocatalytic plating) is electro-plating without electricity. It relies instead on a difference in what is called electropotential when a metal is placed in a solution containing ions of another metal. Metal ions from the solution are deposited on the catalytic surface of the component by the action of a chemical reducing agent present in a metallic salt solution. In the case of electro-less plating of nickel (the most significant commercial application of the process), the salt is nickel chloride and the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphate. Once started the reaction can continue and there is no theoretical limit to the thickness of the coating. Electro-less plating is used when it is impossible or impractical to use normal electroplating - when complex internal surfaces are to be plated, or when dimensional accuracy of the component is critical, for instance.
