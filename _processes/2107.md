MECHANICAL POLISHING is slow and expensive, and should be used only when absolutely necessary. There are many variants, among them: lapping, honing and polishing. All make use of a fine abrasive, suspended in wax, oil or some other fluid, that is rubbed against the surface to be polished by a polishing disk, a belt or a shaped former.

GRINDING is a cruder process, but still one that allows precision in dimensioning and finishing a surface. It works best on hard surfaces; soft surfaces smear and contaminate ('glaze') the grinding wheel.
