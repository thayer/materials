Many products are made by cutting, pressing, punching, folding or spinning of sheet. Press forming covers a range of sheet forming processes that use a die and a press; these include blanking, shearing, drawing and stretching. They may be performed consecutively to form complex shapes. Tools are dedicated, so tooling costs are high. In roll forming a continuous strip of sheet metal is fed through a series of shaped rolls, gradually forming it to the desired profile. The process is suited for long lengths of constant, sometimes complex, cross sections. Hollow components are possible by incorporating seem welding into the process. High production rates, tooling and capital costs make the process economic only for large production levels. In Spinning a circular blank of sheet metal is formed over a rotating mandrill or forming block, against which it is pressed by a rigid tool or roller as it spins. The tools are very simple, made of wood or metal, and are therefore cheap.
