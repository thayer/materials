When, in 1800, Alessandro Volta discovered how make an electric battery, he unleashed the development of electro-chemistry. By 1806 Humphrey Davy, prolific inventor, had developed ways of plating metals from their salts and solutions - ELECTRO-PLATING. The component (cathode) and the metallizing source material (anode) are submerged in the aqueous electrolyte where a direct electrical current drives metal ions from the source material to the component, creating a thin metal coating.
