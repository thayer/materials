VACUUM ASSISTED RESIN TRANSFER MOLDING (VARTM) is a low-cost tooling way of manufacturing large complex shapes of composite materials. Reinforcement is placed in the mold in the form of layers of dry, woven fabric. This is covered by a peel ply and the whole lot is vacuum bagged. Resin is released and sucked into the bag by the vacuum, flowing through and impregnating the fabric, which is then cured.
