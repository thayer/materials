In PULTRUSION, resin-impregnated fibers or fabrics are pulled through a series of hardened steel forming dies. The last die is heated to cure the resin, producing a rigid composite section. The profile is determined by the die cross-section; solid or hollow circular, rectangular, square sections, and channel and I-sections, are all possible. The speed of travel through the die is determined by the viscosity, thickness and curing of the resin. The section produced is either cut into discrete lengths after the puller system or wound onto a drum.
