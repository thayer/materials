description: "RESIN TRANSFER MOLDING (RTM) allows manufacture of complex shapes in fiber-reinforced composites without high tooling costs. It uses a closed mold, in two or more parts, usually made of glass-reinforced polymers or light metal alloys, with injection points and vents to allow air to escape. Reinforcement is cut to shape and placed in the mold, together with any inserts or fittings. The mold is closed and a low viscosity thermosetting resin (usually polyester) is injected under low pressure (roughly 2MPa) through a mixing head in which hardener is blended with the resin. The mold is allowed to cure at room temperature. The molding is allowed to cure at room temperature. The fluidity of the resin and the low molding pressure allows long tool life at low cost."
