description: "BLOW MOLDING is glass blowing technology adapted to polymers. In extrusion blow molding a tube or parison is extruded and clamped in a split mold with a hollow mandrel at one end. Hot air is forced under pressure through the mandrel, blowing the polymer against the mold walls where it cools and freezes. In injection blow molding, a pre-form is injection molded over a mandrel and transferred to the blowing die. Air is injected under pressure through the mandrel blowing the polymer against the mold walls where it cools and freezes, as before. The process gives better control over finished component weight and wall thickness than extrusion blow-molding, with better precision in the unblown, injection molded neck areas, lending itself to screw closures, etc. Solid handles can be molded in. In stretch blow molding, an important variant, the temperature is chosen such that the polymer is drawn as it expands, orienting the molecules in the plane of the surface. It is used in the production of PET drink bottles."
