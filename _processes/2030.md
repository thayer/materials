STEREOLITHOGRAPHY (SLA) is the oldest and most widely used of the additive manufacturing systems. It is a vector scan process which uses a mirror to guide a UV laser to cure selected parts of a thin film of a photo-sensitive resin, building up a solid plastic object point-by point. When all points in one layer are complete, the part is lowered on a platform into the resin bath (typically by 0.1 mm) so that a new layer of liquid resin can be wiped across its surface. Cleaning followed by post-processing UV curing is needed to completely solidify the prototype. Fabricating an SLA part requires a CAD model of the part.
