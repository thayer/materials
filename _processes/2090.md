Powder methods have particular value in shaping difficult materials -- ceramics and refractory metals, for instance - that are too brittle to deform and have high melting temperatures so cannot be easily cast. In POWDER PRESSING AND SINTERING, the loose powder is packed in a shaped mold of steel, graphite or ceramic in which it is sintered at a temperature, typically, of 2/3 of the melting temperature of the powder. In pressing and sintering, the powder is first compressed in a cold die, giving it just sufficient strength to be handled, allowing it to be sintered as a free-standing body. Better densification, strength and ductility are given by hot pressing, which combines compaction and sintering into one operation. The powder is heated in a graphite or ceramic die under sufficient pressure to compact the powder to nearly full density. The process is mainly used for components that are too large for regular cold pressing and sintering. Its use is limited by the cost of dies, the difficulty in heating and atmospheric control and the length of time required for a cycle. Vacuum hot pressing is used for powders that are particularly sensitive to contamination by oxygen or nitrogen (titanium is an example).
