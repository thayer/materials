Joining ceramics poses problems because they are hard and brittle. Mechanical fasteners generally require holes, and create high clamping forces and stress concentrations. Conventional welding is impractical: the melting temperatures of ceramics are very high and residual stresses lead to cracking. Adhesives stick to ceramics, but few are reliable above 300 C, where ceramics are often used. Two processes by-pass these difficulties: Diffusion and Glaze bonding. 

In DIFFUSION BONDING the surfaces to be joined are cleaned, pressed into close contact and heated in vacuum or a controlled atmosphere. Solid state diffusion creates the bond, which is of high quality, but the process is slow and the temperatures are high. GLAZE BONDING depends on the fact that molten glass wets and bonds to almost anything. To exploit this, the surfaces to be joined are first coated with a thin layer of finely-ground glass slurry, with the composition chosen to melt at a temperature well below that for diffusion bonding, and with maximum compatibility between the two surfaces to be joined. A small pressure is applied across the interface and the assembly is heated, melting the glass and forming a thin, but strong bonding layer.
