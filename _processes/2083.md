description: "Large thermoplastic sheet moldings are economically made by THERMOFORMING. In vacuum thermoforming a thermoplastic sheet, heated to its softening point, is sucked against the contours of a mold, taking up its profile; it is then cooled, solidifying against the mold. Drape thermoforming relies partly on vacuum and partly on the natural sag of the hot polymer to form the shape. Plug-assisted thermoforming augments the vacuum with a compression plug. Pressure thermoforming uses a pressure of several atmospheres to force the hot polymer sheet onto the mold. Male or female molds are possible and - for vacuum thermoforming - can be machined from wood, polymer foam, or from aluminum (for larger batch sizes)."
