description: "In FRICTION WELDING, one component is rotated or vibrated at high speed, forced into contact with the other, generating frictional heat at the interface, and - when hot - the two are forged together. In direct drive friction welding, the motor is connected to the work piece and starts and stops with each operation.
 
 In INERTIAL FRICTION WELDING, the motor drives a fly wheel that is disconnected from the motor to make the weld. In friction stir welding a non-consumable rotating tool is pushed onto the materials to be welded. The central pin and shoulder compact the two parts to be joined, heating and plasticizing the materials. As the tool moves along the joint line, material from the front of the tool is swept around to the rear, eliminating the interface. The weld quality is excellent (as good as the best fusion welds), and the process is environmentally friendly."
