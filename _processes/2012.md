In DIFFUSION BONDING the surfaces to be joined are cleaned, pressed into close contact and heated in vacuum
or a controlled atmosphere. Solid state diffusion creates the bond, which is of high quality, but the process is slow
and the temperatures are high. Diffusion bonding is used both for ceramics and metals - among the metals:
titanium, metal matrix composites, and certain steels and copper-based alloys are particular candidates.
GLAZE BONDING depends on the fact that molten glass wets and bonds to almost anything. 

To exploit this, the surfaces to be joined are first coated with a thin layer of finely-ground glass slurry, with the composition chosen to melt at a temperature well below that for diffusion bonding, and with maximum compatibility between the two surfaces to be joined. A small pressure is applied across the interface and the assembly is heated, melting the glass and forming a thin, but strong bonding layer.
