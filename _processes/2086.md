Many resins are sufficiently fluid before polymerization that they can be cast. In RESIN CASTING a mix of resin, hardener and catalyst is poured into a shaped mold without applying pressure. If the part is small the mold can be made of an elastomer, allowing complex cast shapes to be removed without having a split mold. A few thermoplastics - notably acrylics - and most thermosets can be cast.
