BAND SAWING uses a continuous flexible blade that is cycled in one direction around pulley wheels. The blade has to be sufficiently thin to bend around the pulley wheels. It is possible to cut curved contours, but the minimum curvature depends on the cross-section of the blade. Cutting fluids are used for lubrication and cooling when cutting metals.
