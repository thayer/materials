description: "Gas metal arc (MIG) welding is a heavy-duty welding processes (together with MMA and TIG). The electrode here is a bare wire, with no flux. The flux is replaced by a stream of inert gas, which surrounds the arc formed between the consumable wire electrode and the component; the wire is advanced from a coil as the electrode is consumed. The real advantages over torch welding are that there is no flux or slag, giving a cleaner weld - and that it can be automated. But there is a penalty: because the process needs gas, it is more expensive and less portable. None the less, MIG is considered to be the most versatile of all arc welding processes, allowing the welding of most ferrous and non-ferrous alloys in a wide range of thicknesses and all welding positions."
