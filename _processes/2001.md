description: "Structural adhesives are those that are used to perform some mechanical function, though they may have a secondary role as a sealant. Many are rigid, giving a stiff bond (see the record for Rigid Adhesives); but flexible adhesives also play an important role in design. They are classified by their chemical composition.
 
 Flexible adhesives are typified by polyurethanes include and isocyanate-based adhesives, with lap shear strengths of about 8 MPa. They bond well to a wide range of materials, are tough and flexible, have good resistance to water and solvents, and perform well from -50 Â°C to 80 Â°C.
 
 Silicones (SIL) are synthetic polymers in which silicon replaces carbon as the major chain element. Most are two-part systems, their chemistry gives them exceptional flexibility and chemical stability. They are flexible, have useful properties from -115Â°C- 260 Â°C, good resistance to water and UV and IR radiation."
