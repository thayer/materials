Aluminum is a reactive metal, yet in everyday objects it does not corrode or discolor. That is because of a thin oxide film - Al2O3 - that forms spontaneously on its surface, and this film, though invisible, is highly protective. The film can be thickened and its structure controlled by the process of ANODISING. The process is electrolytic; the electrolyte, typically, is dilute (15%) sulfuric acid. The object to be anodized is made the anode (+) of the bath, with a potential difference of a few volts between it and the inert cathode. This sets up an enormous potential gradient across the oxide film, causing it to grow in thickness. The thicker film gives greater protection, and can be colored or patterned.
