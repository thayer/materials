SOLID GROUND CURING (SGC) is an additive manufacturing technique which differs in concept from laser-based methods. A negative image of the layer of the part to be produced is created electrostatically on a glass plate (as in a photocopier). The mask is positioned over a bath of photo-sensitive resin and the clear areas cured by exposure to UV light. The resin is wiped clear, leaving hardened areas intact. Wax is applied to the top surface to provide support to the cured resin, and solidified by chilling. The top surface is then milled back to the required thickness and the next layer of resin is applied for curing. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required.

This technique is now obsolete, having been superseded by Mask Projection Stereolithography (MPSLA) which does not require chilling or milling during the building process.
