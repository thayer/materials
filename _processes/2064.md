In CROPPING and GUILLOTINING an upper blade is forced past a lower one to shear sheet material along a straight line. The blades can be mounted at an angle to give a scissor-like action, reducing the force required. Small guillotines are operated by hand, sometimes with a counter-weight for stronger materials; larger ones are hydraulic or electric. 

The process is used on many different types of material: metal, plastic, paper. The cut edge is burredandslightlydeformed.
