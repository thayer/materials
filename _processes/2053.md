In HAND LAY-UP, an open mold (made of glass-reinforced polymers, wood, plaster, cement or light metal alloys) is coated with a resin to give a smooth surface skin. When this has cured, a layer of reinforcement (woven or knitted glass or carbon fiber) is laid on by hand, resin is applied by a brush or spray gun, and the layer is rolled to distribute the resin fully through the fibers. The process is repeated, layer by layer until the desired thickness is reached. The type of weave influences its ability to take up double curvature ("drapability"): random mat ('glass wool') and knitted fibers have good drapability; weaves with straight wefts do not. Flame retardants and inert fillers are added to reduce cost and improve properties. In SPRAY-UP a resin mixed with chopped fibers is sprayed into the mold; it is used for large components where the reinforcement fraction need not be large.
