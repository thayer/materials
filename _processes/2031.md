ELECTRON BEAM MELTING (EBM) is a powder bed fusion technique similar to SLM. In this process a high-energy electron beam is scanned across a thin layer of metallic powder, causing local melting and resolidification. A thin layer of powder is then spread on top by a wiper or milling head and the process repeated until the object is complete. To maintain a steady-state uniform temperature throughout the build, the substrate is heated before laying the powder bed. Operating at an elevated temperature results in a grain pattern more similar to cast microstructures. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is used to create the code to guide the electron beam.

This process is also known as in-situ shelling.
