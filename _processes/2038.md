Most small aluminum, zinc or magnesium components with a complex shape - camera bodies, housings, the chassis of video recorders - are made by DIE CASTING. It is to metals what injection molding is to polymers, and the two compete directly. In the process, molten metal is injected under high pressure into a metal die through a system of sprues and runners. The pressure is maintained until the component is solid, when the die is opened and the component ejected. The dies are precision-machined from heat-resistant steel and are water cooled to increase life.
