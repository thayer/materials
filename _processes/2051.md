description: "BMC MOLDING is one of the most economical processes for the high volume production of small to medium sized components. In it, a preform of molding compound (resin, reinforcement, catalyst and additives already premixed in the optimum proportions) is placed in the heated mold cavity and then pressed into the finished shape. Pressures used vary between 0.5 and 15 MPa depending on mold dimensions and the material being processed. The mold is heated by steam, electricity or hot oil to temperatures of between 140-160C to cure the resin.
 The heat transferred from the mold surface initiates curing - the length of which varies according to the resin system used and with the component thickness. Because of the low shrinkage additives, the surface finish produced is excellent.
 
 The mold is either made of aluminum, cast iron or steel. The process makes use of a heated hydraulic press."
