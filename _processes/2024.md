3D PRINTING (three-dimensional printing) draws on the technology of ink-jet printers to build up successive layers of a prototype or model. Instead of ink, the print-head deposits thermoplastic photopolymer or wax that quickly sets. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required. The attraction of 3D printing over additive manufacturing techniques is that it uses multiple jets, greatly increasing the speed at which the model can be built. Some machines can print two different materials at once.
This process is also known as material jetting.
