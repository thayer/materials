description: "When the components to be joined cannot tolerate the temperatures required for welding, the alternatives are brazing, soldering, mechanical fasteners or adhesives. Brazing is the hottest of these. In brazing a low melting temperature metal is melted, drawn into the space between the two solid surfaces by capillary motion, and allowed to solidify. Most brazing alloys melt above 450 C but below the melting temperature of the metals being joined. The braze is applied to the heated joint as wire, foil or powder, coated or mixed with flux, where it is melted by a gas-air torch, by induction heating or by insertion of the components into a furnace; the components are subsequently cooled in air."
