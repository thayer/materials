Sheet metal is perforated and profiled by a number of specific processes. All rely on shear-fracture of the sheet. In PUNCHING a circular or shaped hole is punched through the sheet by a hardened die. In PERFORATING an array of punches operate as one unit, creating a pattern of holes in one operation. In BLANKING a shaped disk is createdbypunchingfromasheetbyapunchwiththedesiredshapematingwithadiewiththeinverseshape. In NIBBLING a sheet, supported on an anvil, is cut or trimmed to a desired profile by successive bites from a small, hardened punch, with an action much like that of a sewing machine.
