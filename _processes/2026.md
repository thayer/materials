BALLISTIC PARTICLE MANUFACTURE (BPM) is a rapid prototyping technique in which microscopic particles of molten thermoplastic are shot by a piezoelectric jetting system and freeze when they hit the object being created. A wide range of materials can be used. As with other rapid prototyping processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required.

The process is now obsolete, having been superseded by inkjet methods (3D printing).
