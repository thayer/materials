description: "Texture can be created in many ways. By CASTING or MOLDING in a patterned tool; but the draft angle must be increased with the depth of texture. By ROLLING between patterned rolls. 'Diamond plate', used for stair treads, is made in this way. By CRIMPING, pressing of sheet between patterned dies. Pre-plated sheet, up to 0.8mm thick, can be crimped to give sparkling reflective patterns; it is used, too, to increase bending stiffness and strength, allowing lighter gauge material for boxes and cans. By SAND BLASTING, or abrasive polishing, the microscopic roughening of the surface in a random or patterned way (as in 'brushed aluminum'). By LASER TEXTURING, usually applied to rolls or dies; the pulsed laser beam creates minute craters on the roll surface in a precisely controlled pattern that is then transferred to the component during the rolling operation. By ELECTRO-TEXTURING, a process like electro-discharge machining (EDM), but using shaped graphite electrodes to smooth or give texture to the surface of the component. By CHEMICAL ENGRAVING ('etching' and 'chemical polishing') either of molds, rolls and dies, or of the component itself."
