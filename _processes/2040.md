description: "In LOW PRESSURE DIE CASTING, molten metal is displaced upwards into a die by low pressure gas. The die cavity is filled slowly upwards which minimizes entrained air and gives high soundness. Such castings have better metallurgical integrity than conventional die castings, and they can be heat-treated. The process has most of the benefits of die casting without the disadvantages. The dies are made from cast iron which is comparatively cheap and easy to machine. Tool steel inserts may be used for high production runs of complex castings. Tooling costs are about half those for pressure die casting. The process is only suitable for low melting point alloys (Tm < 950 C). Shapes are of average complexity and undercuts are possible but expensive."
