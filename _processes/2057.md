In rolling a metal ingot is squeezed to shape by massive rolls that subject it to large plastic deformation. Nearly 90% of all steel products are rolled or forged. Billet and sheet are made by plane rolling, I-beams and other such continuous sections are made by shape rolling. In hot rolling, the ingot, heated to about 2/3 of its melting temperature, is forced through a series of rolls that progressively shape the profile.
