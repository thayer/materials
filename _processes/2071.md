In ABRASIVE JET MACHINING material is removed from workpieces by a high speed stream of abrasive particles in an air or gas jet. The jet is focused through a nozzle made of tungsten or sapphire to resist abrasion. It is used for machining delicate or very hard materials. The process has the advantage of producing no heat damage to workpiece surfaces. A taper is produced in deep cuts. The distance of the nozzle from the workpiece affects the size of the machined area and the removal rate.
