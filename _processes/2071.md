TURNING generates external surfaces of revolution by removing material from a rotating workpiece with a single-tipped cutting tool. The workpiece is gripped in a chuck mounted in a lathe that provides the rotary motion. BORING is this same action applied to internal surfaces of revolution. It is the most commonly used process for enlarging or finishing holes or other circular contours. Although most boring operations are done on simple, straight-through holes (ranging upward in diameter from about 6 mm), tooling can be designed for boring blind holes, holes with bottle-shaped configurations and bores with steps, undercuts, and counterbores. Boring is used after drilling to increase dimensional accuracy and finish, and for finishing holes too large to be produced economically by drilling, such as large cored holes in castings or large pierced holes in forgings. PARTING is the separation of a turned object from the stock from which it was made by turning the section down to zero.
