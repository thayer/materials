HOT PLATE WELDING makes butt joints between bulk thermoplastic components, in a kind of inversion of the way that hot bar welding makes lap joints. The components to be joined are held in fixtures that press them against an electrically heated, PTFE coated, platen, melting the surface and softening the material beneath it. The pressure is lifted, the tool withdrawn and the hot polymer surfaces are pressed together and held there until they have cooled. Hot plate welding can be used to form joints of large area - for example, the joining of large polyethylene gas and water pipes. The process is relatively slow, requiring weld times between 10 seconds for small components and 1 hour for very large.
