description: "In forging a metal ingot is squeezed to shape by dies that subject it to large plastic deformation. Nearly 90% of all steel products are either forged or rolled. In hot die forging a heated blank is formed between open or closed dies in a single compressive stroke. Often a succession of dies is used to create the final shape. In cold rolling and forging the metal blank is initially cold, although deformation causes some heating.
 
 The greatest precision and shape complexity is given by closed-die forging, illustrated below, but the size of component is limited to about 20 kg. Open-die forging is less precise, but can be applied to much larger components (up to 5000 kg)."
