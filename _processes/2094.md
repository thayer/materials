description: "In NITRIDING, nitrogen is introduced into the surface of a steel component by heating it in a fused salt bath containing nitrogen-baring salts (typically, sodium cyanide, NaCN) or in a gas stream containing cracked ammonia (NH3). Steels suitable for nitriding contain aluminum, vanadium, tungsten or molybdenum; these form stable nitride precipitates that harden the surface to a depth of about 500 microns. The temperature - 495 to 565 C - is lower than that for carburizing, giving less distortion, and the surface does not require later heat treatment (as carburizing does) to acquire its hardness. Nitriding gives a high surface hardness, retained to high temperatures, increased wear resistance, improved fatigue life, and enhanced corrosion resistance."
