In GRAVITY DIE or PERMANENT MOLD CASTING, molten metal is poured under gravity into a metal mold where it remains until it solidifies. The mold is then opened and the casting is removed. The mold is usually made of cast iron, but low carbon steels and die steels can also be used. The dies can be of relatively simple construction produced in two halves. Metal or sand cores can be used for making internal details. Shapes are relatively simple with simple coring and fairly uniform wall thickness. The process can be mechanized.
