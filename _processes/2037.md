description: "ULTRASONIC CONSOLIDATION (UC) is a hybrid additive-subtractive process in which an object is built up from layers of metal foil. many foils side-by side which is bonded using ultrasonic metal seam welding, then after around 40 layers, trimmed using CNC millin rotating sonotrode travels along the length of each foil strip as it is laid down. This device oscillates at 20kHz transversely to the dir causing metallic bonds to form between sheets. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is re
 
 The process is also known as ultrasonic additive manufacturing."
