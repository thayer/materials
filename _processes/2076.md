In WATER JET CUTTING and MACHINING (WJM or HDM) water is pumped at high pressure (up to 400 MPa) through a sapphire nozzle with a diameter of 0.1 - 0.3 mm, from which it emerges with a velocity of up to 850 m/s -- roughly 3 times the speed of sound. This gives it enough kinetic energy to slice through relatively soft materials such as plastics, thin composites, paper, leather and food stuffs. The range of materials is extended by a modification of the process in which an abrasive grit such as garnet is entrained then the water jet. The maximum thickness that can be cut depends on the hardness of the material.
