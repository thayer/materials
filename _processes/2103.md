WATER-BASED (or LATEX) PAINTS are synthetic resins and pigments, plus coalescing agents, that are kept dispersed in water by surfactants. They dry by evaporation of the water; the coalescing agents cause the particles of resin to fuse together (coalesce) as the water evaporates to form a continuous coating. Water-based paints are displacing those based on organic solvents because their volatile organic compound (VOC) content is much lower, thereby reducing VOC emissions and air pollution.
