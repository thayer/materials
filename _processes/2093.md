description: "Lasers are a clean, controllable heat source for surface treatment and welding (see also the record for laser welding). The laser beam scans the surface to cause a phase change for localized heat treatment, or to melt it for localized structure-change. This allows three sorts of process: surface transformation hardening, surface shocking, and surface melting and glazing. All can be applied to selected areas of the surface.
 
 
 In SURFACE TRANSFORMATION HARDENING (limited to carbon and alloy steels) the beam heats a spot on the surface to a temperature above that for the transmission to austenite. As the beam moves on, the hotspot is quenched by conduction of heat into the massive, cold interior of the component, transforming a thin surface layer to martensite. Single, separated tracks give a surface with good wear resistance - the alternating the hard and soft bands contribute to this. Overlapping tracks give a more uniform hardening of the entire surface.
 
 
 LASER SHOCK HARDENING uses a pulsed, high energy beam to violently vaporize a minute amount of surface material, creating a shock wave that locally deforms the underlying solid, while hardening it like shock peening.
 
 
 LASER SURFACE MELTING involves the use of a high intensity beam to scan the surface, protected by a shielding-gas, melting it. The subsequent rapid quench by conduction into the interior produces a track with a refined and homogenized microstructure. Laser glazing is a melting process carried out at a high processing speed such as the cooling rates between 10,000 and 1,000,000Â°C/sec can be achieved. At this cooling rate, metallic glass formation is possible if the alloy composition has a high glass-forming tendency."
