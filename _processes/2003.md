Mechanical fasteners have three special attractions: they do not require heat; they can join dissimilar materials; and these can be of very different thickness. RIVETS are widely used in aircraft design - a testament to their strength, permanence and reliability. Riveting is done by inserting a stud with a head on one end through pre-drilled holes in the mating components, and clinching (squashing) the other end where it sticks out by hitting it with a shaped hammer. STAPLES - familiar as a way of binding paper and attaching leather and cloth to frames in furniture - are fast and cheap; they can also be used to assemble sheet metal. Staples are applied with a spring-loaded, electric or pneumatic jig that forces the staple through the materials and onto a grooved anvil, bending the legs inwards and pinching the materials together. In blind stapling there is no anvil - the legs of the staple are simply driven through one material into the other, where they stick in the same way that nails do.
