description: "In AUTOCLAVE MOLDING, reinforcement is layed-up on the mold and the resin is applied by conventional hand or spray lay-up techniques. The laminate is backed with a porous film parting agent and a layer of glass-fiber cloth or paper to absorb any excess resin. A flexible bag is placed on top of the glass-fiber layer. The laminate and the mold are then placed inside an autoclave and subjected to pressures of about 0.55 MPa compressing the laminate, squeezing out air pockets to give a dense product free from porosity. The autoclave is often heated to accelerate curing and increase productivity. Autoclave molding is used extensively to fabricate high strength aircraft and aerospace components. particularly for thicker parts or where high fiber volume fraction is required."
