The LOW PRESSURE SAND CASTING or COSWORTH process is a high-precision sand casting process developed for the production of premium quality aluminum alloy castings for the automobile industry.
Zircon sand is used in place of the more usual silica sand to overcome the problem of unpredictable expansion, allowing more precise castings. The sand is mixed with a binder and shaped into a mold before the curing agent is introduced. The curing agent in the form of a gas (the gas hardening SO2 process) is passed through the sand/binder mixture resulting in the polymerization of the resin.

Metal is melted and held in an electric resistance furnace. The metal is transferred by a pump from the furnace to the mold and enters the base of the mold through gates. These gates, together with the pump control system, control the rate of mold filling and provide pressure assisted feeding. The absence of conventional gating and feeding systems results in castings free of porosity and inclusions.
