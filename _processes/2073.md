description: "ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE WIRE CUTTING (EDWC) uses a continuously spooled conductive wire (usually brass) as an electrode. A power supply generates rapid electric pulses that create a discharge between the workpiece and wire electrode. The discharge causes the melting, and probably the vaporization, of a minute piece of material, slowly eating into the work piece. Any electrical conductive material can be machined irrespective of hardness. The wire is positioned relative to the workpiece by numerical control. On some machines the wire can be tilted to create tapered parts. An advantage of this process is that no mechanical stresses are created in the workpiece because the wire does not make contact with it."
