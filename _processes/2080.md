No other process has changed product design more than INJECTION MOLDING. Injection molded products appear in every sector of product design: consumer products, business, industrial, computers, communication, medical and research products, toys, cosmetic packaging and sports equipment. The most common equipment for molding thermoplastics is the reciprocating screw machine, shown schematically in the figure. Polymer granules are fed into a spiral press where they mix and soften to a dough-like consistency that can be forced through one or more channels ('sprues') into the die. The polymer solidifies under pressure and the component is then ejected. Thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers can all be injection molded. Co-injection allows molding of components with different materials, colors and features. Injection foam molding allows economical production of large molded components by using inert gas or chemical blowing agents to make components that have a solid skin and a cellular inner structure.
