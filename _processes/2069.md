description: "PLANING is a machining process for removing metal from surfaces in horizontal, vertical, or angular planes. In this process, the workpiece is reciprocated in a linear motion against one or more single-point tools. Although planing is most widely used for producing flat surfaces on large workpieces, the process can also be used to produce contours and a variety of irregular shapes, such as deep slots, helical grooves , and internal guide surfaces. SHAPING AND SLOTTING are machining processes that remove metal from surfaces with a single-point tool mounted on a reciprocating ram."
