description: "In 3D CERAMIC MOLD PRINTING, a multi-jet print head, like that of a bubble-jet printer, deposits a binder on a bed of fine foundry sand. After each sweep of the print head, a new, thin, layer of sand is spread across the surface of the model, so that on the next sweep of the print head a new layer of bonded sand is created. The final model, after shaking it free of unbonded sand, now becomes the mold for a shell casting, allowing single metal parts with very complex shapes to be fabricated. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required."
