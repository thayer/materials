description: "The idea here is this: take a medium or high carbon steel -- cheap, easily formed and machined -- and flash its surface temperature up into the austenitic phase-region, from which it is rapidly cooled from a gas or liquid jet, giving a martensitic surface layer. The result is a tough body with a hard, wear and fatigue resistant, surface skin. Both processes allow the surface of carbon steels to be hardened with minimum distortion or oxidation. In INDUCTION HARDENING, a high frequency (up to 50kHz) electromagnetic field induces eddy-currents in the surface of the work-piece, locally heating it; the depth of hardening depends on the frequency. In FLAME HARDENING, heat is applied instead by high-temperature gas burners, followed, as before, by rapid cooling. Both processes are versatile and can be applied to work pieces that cannot readily be furnace treated or case hardened in the normal way."
