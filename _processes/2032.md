SELECTIVE LASER MELTING (SLM) is a powder bed fusion technique. A laser beam is scanned across the surface, as with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), but in this case it completely melts the powder locally to produce a fully dense model without the need for infiltration. As each layer is completed a new thin layer of powder is swept over the top by a wiper or milling head and the process repeated. Although analogous to EBM, the substrate is not heated so the temperature of the object increases during production. The result is an unusual microstructure unlike that of parts which have been cast. As with other additive manufacturing processes, a CAD solid model of the part is required.
