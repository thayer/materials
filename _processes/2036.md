description: "In LAMINATED OBJECT MANUFACTURE (LOM) the prototype or model is usually built up from layers of paper (polymers or metals are also possible with some machines), laminated with a heat sensitive polymer binder. To create one layer, binder-coated sheet material is fed from a roll, positioned over the model, and cut to shape by a guided laser beam. The cut profile is pressed onto the model by a heated roller, bonding it to the layers beneath and the sequence is repeated. The process is faster than SLA or SLS because only the outline of the part needs to be covered by the laser. When using paper the finished material resembles wood. As with other rapid prototyping processes, a CAD solid model of the part is used to create the instructions to guide the laser."
