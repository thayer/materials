In CIRCULAR SAWING a rotating cutting blade is fed horizontally, vertically, or at an angle into the workpiece. The rigidity of the machine allows high precision and the cutting blade and can produce burr-free surfaces, reducing the need for further finishing. Circular sawing produces a wider cut than band sawing, although circular saws as thin as 1.5 mm (0.060 in.) are available. Thin blades, however, cannot maintain the tolerances and high cutting forces for which circular sawing is noted.
