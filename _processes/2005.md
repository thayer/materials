SNAP FITS, like other mechanical fastenings, involve no heat, they join dissimilar materials, they are fast and
cheap and - if designed to do so - they can be disassembled. It is essential that the snap can tolerate the relatively
large elastic deflection required for assembly or disassembly. Polymers, particularly, meet this requirement, though
springy metals, too, make good snap fits.
