general_applications: "Wire and cable covers; high-quality insulating tape; corrosion resistant lining for pipes and valves; protective coatings; seals and gaskets; low friction bearings and skis; transparent roofing and weather protection for other polymers (e.g. ABS); non-stick cooking products; water repellent fabrics."
description: "PTFE (Teflon) is a member of the fluoroplastic family, which includes chlorotrifluoroethylene, CTFE or CFE, polyvinyl fluoride, PVF, and polyvinylidene fluoride PVF2. PTFE has exceptionally low friction, is water repellant, and extremely stable. It was first commercialized in the late 1940's as Teflon. Non-stick cooking utensils (Tefal = Teflon coated aluminum) exploiting its chemical inertness, its thermal stability and its non-wettability - the reason nothing sticks to it. It is expensive as polymers go, but it is used in high-value applications (non-stick pans; Gore-Tex rain gear; artificial arteries)."
