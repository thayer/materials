general_applications: "Injection molded - pencil sharpeners, rulers, cartridges, toys, plant pots, plastic bones and other toys for pets, plastic cutlery, hair combs.
Thermo-formed - trays for fresh food packaging, especially fruit and vegetables.
Film extrusion - shopping bags, bubble film for wrapping, plastic laminates for paper cups and plates, bags for rubbish disposal, lining for baby nappies, mulching films for horticulture, wrapping for fruit, vegetables and sanitary products."
description: "Starch is a naturally occurring polysaccharide made up of glucose molecules. Its molecular chains are shorter than those of cellulose and the bonds between the sugar molecule building blocks are different. Starch is therefore a polymer, but the problem with using it for making structural products is that it is softened by and dissolves in water. Mater-Bi is a family of biodegradable thermoplastics materials made from maize starch. They are water resistant and resembles polymers made from petro-chemicals. They retain their properties while in use, but when composted in an environment containing bacteria, they biodegrade to carbon dioxide, water and fibrous residue."
