description: "Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a high-performance thermoplastic, meaning that - among thermoplastics - it has exceptionally high stiffness, strength and resistance to heat. This comes at a price - PEEK is 50 times more expensive than PP, and 10 to 20 times more than nylon. This limits it use to applications in which technical performance is paramount."
