description: "Tungsten carbide (WC) is most commonly used in the form of a 'cemented' carbide, or cermet - particles of WC held by a small amount (5-20%) of metallic binder, usually cobalt. Its exceptional hardness and stability make it an attractive material when wear resistance is essential. Properties depend on grain size and shape and the proportion of carbide to metal. Cermets are expensive but, as cutting tools, they survive cutting speeds 10 times those of the best tool steel. Shaping is usually done by pressing, sintering and then grinding; the tool bit is brazed to a shank or blade made from a cheaper steel. Cermets can be vapor-coated with titanium nitride to improve wear resistance even further."
