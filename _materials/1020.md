Carbon steel is steel in which the main alloying constituent is carbon.  The term “carbon steel” can be used to refer to steel which is not stainless steel. Medium carbon steel hardens when quenched - a quality that gives great control over properties.

***General properties**:* 0.25-0.7% carbon, very strong, high Hardenability. and good wear resistance.

***General applications**:* Tools, large parts, forging and automotive components.
