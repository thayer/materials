description: "Slates are formed by the deposition of clay and mud, consolidated by pressure. Their most striking features are their ability to be cleaved, producing flat slabs or sheets, and their impermeability to water in a direction normal to the cleavage plain. Because of this, slate has been used for centuries for roof tiles, pavings and floors when laid directly on bare earth. Slate is exceptionally durable and weather resistant - if maintained, slate roofs last for hundreds of years. The fine texture and uniform subdued coloring leads also to the decorative use of slate, in stair treads, signs and grave stones."
