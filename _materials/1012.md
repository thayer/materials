description: "Sandstone is consolidated sand particles (quartz), bonded by a cementing agent - feldspars, limes, silica or clays. The size of the sand particles, the porosity and the strength vary greatly in different sandstones. The colors derive from iron or manganese impurities and give sandstones their character."
