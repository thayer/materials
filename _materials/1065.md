general_applications: "Electrical contacts; linings for chemical reactor vessels; linings for heavy duty journal bearings; jewellery, table wear, photography, batteries, pharmaceuticals, lead-free solders and control rods of nuclear reactors. Aluminum and rhodium can be substituted for silver in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces. Tantalum can be used in place of silver for surgical plates, pins, and sutures. Stainless steel is an alternate material used widely in the manufacture of table flatware. Nonsilver batteries being developed may replace silver batteries in some applications. Silverless black and white film, xerography, and film with reduced silver content are alternatives to some uses of silver in photography."
description: "If gold is the king of metals, silver is the queen. Silver is a soft, white metal with the highest electrical and thermal conductivities of any metal. It occurs as native silver but most is produced as a by-product of copper, lead and zinc refining.Silver is valued as a precious metal, use for jewellery, tableware, musical instruments and currency. It has many industrial applications as electrical contacts and conductors, as a catalyst, in photographic film and photo-voltaics, in batteries, in pharmaceuticals, in lead-free solders and in control rods of nuclear reactors. The important industrial uses of silver compete with its desirability as a hedge against inflation, leading to volatile pricing."
