description: "Borosilicate glass is soda lime glass with most of the lime replaced by borax, B203. It has a higher melting point than soda lime glass and is harder to work; but it has a lower expansion coefficient and a high resistance to thermal shock, so it is used for glassware and laboratory equipment."
