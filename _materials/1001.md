Aluminum is remarkable for the metalâ€™s low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. The most useful compounds of aluminum, at least on a weight basis, are the oxides and sulfates.*- Wikipedia, 2015-10-19*
