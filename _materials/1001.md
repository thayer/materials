> Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials.[clarification needed] The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the oxides and sulfates. - Wikipedia, 2015-10-19
