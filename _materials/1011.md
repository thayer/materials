description: "Marble is the purest form of limestone. It is almost pure calcium carbonate that has been compacted and heated such that it has recrystallized. It is used for ornamental building, statuary, ornamental furniture and for electric power panels. The purest marble (Italian Carrara marble is an example) is very white, delicate in texture and hard. Other marbles are dark green, red, black or gray, allowing their use for decorative patterning like that of the Basilica shown in the picture."
