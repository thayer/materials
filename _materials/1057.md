It is a terpolymer made by polymerizing Styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of polybutadiene, resulting in a long chain of polybutadiene criss-crossed with shorter chains of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile).

The styrene gives the plastic a shiny surface. The polybutadiene, a rubbery substance, provides toughness even at low temperatures.

**General Properties**: Tough, resilient, light weight, and easily molded.

**Applications**: musical instruments, gold club heads, automotive trim components and bumper bars, protective headgear, and medical devices for blood access.
