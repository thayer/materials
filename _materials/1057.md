description: "Gold is the king of metals. Its name has entered the language as a symbol of perfection, achievement, good fortune and security - golden ages, golden ratios, golden rules, gold standards, golden crowns, golden girl, go for gold, gilded lives. When times are bad and investments insecure, investors turn to gold. Its rich color, its malleability, its resistance to almost all corrosion and its sheer scarcity combine to make it the most desirable of metals. Some 90% of the global production of gold gets squirreled away as bullion and jewelry. The remaining 10% plays vital roles in the electronics industry as interconnects and as surface layers on connectors. Its high electrical conductivity and resistance to attack allow extreme miniaturization. Its use in dentistry, once large, is diminishing."
