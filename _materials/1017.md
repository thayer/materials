description: "Silicon is the second most abundant element, exceeded only by oxygen and making up 26% of the earth's crust by weight. It is found largely as silicon oxides such as sand (silica), quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, agate, flint, jasper and opal, and as silicates asbestos, feldspar, clay and mica. It is a reactive element, important as an alloying element in steels, cast irons, and certain copper and aluminum alloys where it gives both corrosion resistance and strength. Silicon is transparent to infrared and is used a windows and lenses for IR lasers. Its most important application, of course, is as a semiconductor, the mainstay of the electronics industry. Silicon is present in the sun and stars and is a principal component of a class of meteorites known as aerolites. Silicon is important in plant and animal life. Diatoms in both fresh and salt water extract silica from the water to use as a component of their cell walls. Silicon is an important ingredient in steel. Silicon carbide is one of the most important abrasives. Workers in environments where silica-containing dust is breathed may develop a serious lung disease known as silicosis. Hydrolysis and condensation of substituted chlorosilanes can be used to produce a very great number of polymeric products, or silicones. These range from liquids to hard, glasslike solids with many useful properties. Elemental silicon transmits more than 95% of all wavelengths of infrared and has been used in lasers to produce coherent light at 456 nm."
