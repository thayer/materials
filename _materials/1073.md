description: "Ethylene-Vinyl-Acetate elastomers (EVA) are built around polyethylene. They are soft, flexible and tough, and retain these properties down to -60 C. Fillers improve both hardness and stiffness, but with some degradation of other properties. EVAs blend well with PE because of their chemical similarity. EVA is available in pastel or deep hues; it has good clarity and gloss. It has good barrier properties, little or no odor, is UV resistance and FDA-approval for direct food contact. The toughness and flexibility is retained even at low temperatures and it has good stress-crack resistance and good chemical resistance. EVA can be processed by most normal thermoplastic processes - co-extrusion for films, blow molding, rotational molding, injection molding and transfer molding."
