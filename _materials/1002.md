description: "Glass ceramics are glasses that, to a greater or lesser extent, have crystallized. They are shaped while in the glassy state, using ordinary molding methods and then cooled in such a way that the additives they contain nucleate small crystals. It is sold for cooking as pyroceram and is used for high performance heat resisting applications."
