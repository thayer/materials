general_applications: "Roofs, wall cladding, pipe work, window seals, and flooring in buildings; sculpture and table wear as pewter; solder for electrical circuits and for mechanical joining, bearings, printing type ('Type metal'), ammunition, pigments, X-ray shielding, corrosion resistant material in the chemical industry and electrodes for lead acid batteries."
description: "Lead, when pure, is very soft and, with it low melting point (327 C) it creeps, even at room temperature -- old lead pipes acquire a sag between fixing points over time. There are two broad classes of alloys base on lead. The first, typified by the lead-antimony (Pb-Sb) alloys, are designed to increase the strength and resistance to creep while retaining the excellent corrosion resistance of lead. They are used for roofing, guttering, cladding and for sound insulation of buildings. The second, typified by the lead-tin alloys (Pb-Sn) are designed as solders and have an even lower melting point than lead (as low as 183 C), a temperature easily achieved with a soldering iron or infra-red lamps. The data listed below are for lead-tin solder."
