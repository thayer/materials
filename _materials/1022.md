description: "Metal matrix composites are metals reinforced with ceramic particles. The most widely used are based on aluminum reinforced with particles of silicon carbide or alumina. The reinforcement increases the stiffness, strength and maximum service temperature without seriously increasing the weight. Production now exceeds 10,000 tonnes per year, at a cost of 2 - 5 Â£/kg."
