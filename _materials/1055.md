general_applications: "Tin bronzes and gunmetals - sand casting of marine and architectural fittings, bells, pump parts, taps and valves, coinage. Aluminum bronzes - die-cast and wrought components, particularly those to resist corrosion; heat exchangers; condensers; ships propellers and marine fittings; architectural cladding; valve and pump bodies. Phosphor bronzes - bearings and gears; springs; pump parts; coinage; tubing a plate to resist corrosion and erosion."
description: "Bronze, the material of the Bronze age (3000 - 1000 BC) was originally an alloy of copper (Cu) and tin (Sn), but today the term is used for any alloy of copper that has a principal alloying element other than zinc or nickel. The tin bronzes contain 5 - 25% Sn; those with more than 10% Sn have high strength but little ductility, so they must be cast to shape. Aluminum bronzes (Cu with 4 - 14% Al plus a little Mn) have high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. Phosphor bronzes (Cu with 1.25 - 10% Sn and up to 0.6% P) have low friction coefficient and are widely used for bearings. Gunmetal is a tin bronze containing some zinc and lead."
