description: "Birch is a hardwood harvested in most of the Northern Hemisphere. And even though it is a relative to the oak, the lumber is much harder than oak. Birch is widely used in the cabinet industry, mostly because it makes superior plywood that is stable, affordable and readily available in most home improvement stores."
