description: "Polymer foams are made by the controlled expansion and solidification of a liquid or melt through a blowing agent; physical, chemical or mechanical blowing agents are possible. The resulting cellular material has a lower density, stiffness and strength than the parent material, by an amount that depends on its relative density - the volume-fraction of solid in the foam. Flexible foams can be soft and compliant, the material of cushions, mattresses, and padded clothing. Most are made from polyurethane, although latex (natural rubber) and most other elastomers can be foamed."
