description: "Butyl Rubbers (IIR) are synthetics that resemble natural rubber (NR) in properties. They have good resistance to abrasion, tearing and flexing, with exceptionally low gas permeability and useful properties up to 150 C. They have low dielectric constant and loss, making them attractive for electrical applications."
