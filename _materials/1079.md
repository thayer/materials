description: "Styrene Butadiene Copolymer Rubber (SBR) is the synthetic rubber that is most widely used and has the highest production volume. It is nearly always compounded with reinforcing fillers such as carbon black.Strengths - When filled, its strength approaches natural rubber (NR) and polychloroprene. Similar chemical and physical properties to NR and somewhat better abrasion resistance.Limitations - Weaker and lower fatigue resistance than natural rubber (it does not undergo strain-induced crystallation) especially when unfilled. Like NR - prone to oxidation, degrades in ozone, swells readily in hydrocarbon fluids with loss of properties."
