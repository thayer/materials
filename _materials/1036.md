description: "Cork is a natural closed-cell foam, and is waterproof and remarkably stable, surviving in the neck of a wine bottle for 50 years or more without decay or contaminating the wine. Corkboard, made by compressing granulated cork under heat, is used for wall and ceiling insulation. Cork itself has a remarkable combination of properties. It is light yet resilient, insulates against heat and sound, has a high coefficient of friction, is imperious to liquids, chemically stable and fire resistant. Demand for cork exceeds 500,000 tones per year - and one tonne of cork has the same volume as 56 tonnes of steel."
