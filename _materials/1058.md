general_applications: "Roofs, wall cladding, pipe work, window seals, and flooring in buildings; sculpture and table wear as pewter; solder for electrical circuits and for mechanical joining, bearings; printing type; ammunition; pigments, X-ray shielding; corrosion resistant material in the chemical industry; electrodes for lead acid batteries; protective cable coverings."
description: "When the Romans conquered Britain in 43AD they discovered rich deposits of lead ore and started a mining and refining industry that was to continue for 1000 years (the symbol for lead - Pb - derives from its Latin name - Plumbum). They used it for pipes, cisterns, and for roofs - this last a use that continues to the present day. For many years tea was wrapped in lead foil to protect it on the sea voyage from India. The use of lead in many applications is diminishing because of the long-term toxic nature of lead salts, but its qualities as an acoustic insulator and its outstanding resistance to atmospheric corrosion still make it an attractive material for architecture."
