description: "Plywood is laminated wood, the layers glued together such that the grain in successive layers are at right angles, giving stiffness and strength in both directions. The number of layers varies, but is always odd (3, 5, 7...) to give symmetry about the core ply - if it is asymmetric it warps when wet or hot. Those with few plies (3,5) are significantly stronger and stiffer in the direction of the outermost layers; with increasing number of plies the properties become more uniform. High quality plywood is bonded with synthetic resin. The data listed below describe the in-plane properties of a typical 5-ply."
