description: "Nickel forms a wide range of alloys, valued by the chemical engineering and food processing industries for their resistance to corrosion, and by the makers of furnaces and high temperature equipment for their ability to retain useful strength at temperatures up to 1200 C. Typical of these are the nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, often containing some iron (Fe) as well. The chromium increases the already-good resistance to corrosion and oxidation by creating a surface film of Cr203, the same film that makes stainless steel stainless. The data given here are for nickel-chromium alloys. There are separate records for stainless steel and nickel-based super alloys."
