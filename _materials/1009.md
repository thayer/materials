description: "Granite is one of the most durable of materials. The pyramid of Giza (2980 BC) was built of limestone cased in granite. It is a coarse grained igneous rock, very hard and compact. It takes a fine polish, showing the beauty of its crystals. It is the most important stone in building - whole cities are built of it (Edinburgh, in Scotland UK, is an example). It is used for work-surfaces because of its durability, resistance to acids and alkalis, and its decorative appearance. Granites, because of the lack of porosity, do not weather or crack as more porous stones do."
