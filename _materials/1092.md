description: "Polypropylene, PP, first produced commercially in 1958, is the younger brother of polyethylene - a very similar molecule with similar price, processing methods and application. Like PE it is produced in very large quantities (more than 30 million tons per year in 2000), growing at nearly 10% per year, and like PE its molecule-lengths and side-branches can be tailored by clever catalysis, giving precise control of impact strength, and of the properties that influence molding and drawing. In its pure form polypropylene is flammable and degrades in sunlight. Fire retardants make it slow to burn and stabilizers give it extreme stability, both to UV radiation and to fresh and salt water and most aqueous solutions."
