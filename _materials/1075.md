description: "Polychloroprenes (Neoprene, CR) – the materials of wetsuits – are the leading non-tire synthetic rubbers. First synthesized in 1930, they are made by a condensation polymerization of the monomer 2-chloro –1,3 butadiene. The properties can by modified by copolymerization with sulfur, with other chloro-butadienes and by blending with other polymers to give a wide range of properties. Polychloroprenes are characterized by high chemical stability, resistance to water, oil, gasoline and UV radiation."
