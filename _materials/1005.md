**Scientific name**: *Poly(methyl methacrylate)* (PMMA).

This substance, like many other thermoplastics, is often classified as a type of glass although it is not a type of the familiar silica-based glass.

It is an alternative to the more expensive polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not a priority.

***General properties**:* brittle when under load, easy handling and processing, and low cost, but prone to scratching.

***General applications**:* cockpit canopies for fighter aircraft during WWII,  rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles, appliances and lenses for glasses.
