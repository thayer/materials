general_applications: "Vast quantities of cement are used to make concrete for general civil engineering construction, where there is little exposure to sulfates in soil or groundwater. Cements are also used as mortars to cement brick, and as rendering on walls and floors."
description: "We use cement and concrete in vast quantities -- quantities second only to our consumption of water. Cement is a calcined, powdered ceramic that, with the addition of water, can be molded or poured and then sets into a solid mass, bonding well to many surfaces. There are many different cements; the one most widely used construction is Portland cement, so called because the developers sought to promote it as resembling Portland stone, a layered limestone much valued for floors and pavings (the resemblance is a poor one). It is made by calcining a mixture of chalk or limestone and clay, followed by grinding to a fine powder. Mixed with water, it hydrates and sets to a hard gray solid. Portland cement can be used neat, but is more usually used as a binder with aggregates to make mortar and concrete."
