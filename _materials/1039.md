description: "Leather is a natural fabric. It is made by the tanning of animal hide, a smelly process in which the hide is soaked in solutions of tannins for weeks or months, making it pliable and resistant to decay. It has high tensile strength and is exceptionally tough and resilient, yet it is flexible and - as suede - is soft to touch. Leather is used for belts, gaskets, shoes, jackets, handbags, linings and coverings. It can be injection molded by placing a piece in the mold prior to injected the polymer resin."
