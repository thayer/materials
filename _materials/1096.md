description: "PVC - Vinyl - is one of the cheapest, most versatile and - with polyethylene - the most widely used of polymers and epitomizes their multi-facetted character. In its pure form - as a thermoplastic, tpPVC - it is rigid, and not very tough; its low price makes it a cost-effective engineering plastic where extremes of service are not encountered. Incorporating plasticizers creates flexible PVC, elPVC, a material with leather-like or rubber-like properties, and used a substitute for both. By contrast, reinforcement with glass fibers gives a material that is sufficiently stiff, strong and tough to be used for roofs, flooring and building panels. Both rigid and flexible PVC can be foamed to give lightweight structural panels, and upholstery for cars and domestic use. Blending with other polymers extends the range of properties further - vinyl gramophone records were made of a vinyl chloride/acetate co-polymer; blow molded bottles and film are a vinyl chloride/acrylic copolymer."
