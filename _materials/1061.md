description: "Magnesium is a metal almost indistinguishable from aluminum in color, but of lower density. It is the lightest of the light-metal trio (with partners aluminum and titanium) and light it is - a computer case made from magnesium is barely two thirds as heavy as one made from aluminum. It, aluminum and magnesium are the mainstays of airframe engineering. Only beryllium is lighter, but its expense and potential toxicity limit its use to special applications only. Magnesium is flammable, but this is only a problem when it is in the form of powder or very thin sheet. It costs more than aluminum but nothing like as much as titanium. Magnesium and its alloys have a hexagonal crystal structure (unlike aluminum) restricting their ability to be rolled or forged at room temperature. They can however be extruded, forged and rolled above 350 C. This partly accounts for the low consumption of wrought products -- they account for about 25% of Mg alloy consumption."
