description: "Bamboo is nature's gift to the construction industry. Think of it - a hollow tube, exceptionally strong and light, growing so fast that it can be harvested after a year, and - given a little longer - reaching a diameter of 0.3 meters and a height of 15 meters. This and its hard surface and ease of working makes it the most versatile of materials. Bamboo is used for building and scaffolding, for roofs and flooring, for pipes, buckets, baskets, walking sticks, fishing poles, window blinds, mats, arrows and furniture. Tonkin bamboo is strong and flexible (fishing poles); Tali bamboo is used for structural applications (houses or furniture); Eeta bamboo is the fastest growing and is used as a source of cellulose for the production of cellulose or Rayon."
