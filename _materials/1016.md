general_applications: "Slurry nozzles; light weight body armor; pestles and mortars for hard materials; shot blast nozzles; ceramic tooling dies; ballistic tiles; diamond tool dressing; precision tool parts; thread spinning nozzles."
description: "Boron carbide (B4C) is nearly as hard as diamond and vastly less expensive (though still not cheap). Its very low density and high hardness make it attractive for the outer layer of bulletproof body armor, as nozzles for sandblasting and as an abrasive."
