description: "Think of polyurethanes and you think of the soft, the stretchy, materials and fabrics (Lycra or Spandex). Like PVC, polyurethanes have thermoplastic, elastomeric and thermosetting grades. They are easily foamed; some 40% of all PU is made into foam by mixing it with a blowing agent. The foams can be open- or closed-cell, microcellular or filter grades. They are the strongest of elastomers."
