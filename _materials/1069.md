general_applications: "Applications are of four types.
1. Those using the high-temperature capability of tungsten - spark-plug electrodes, lamp filaments,heating elements and furnace windings and electrodes for TIG welding.
2. Those using the high density - balance weights; anti-vibration tooling; armour-piercing penetrators and radiation shielding; and X and gamma-ray shielding
3. Those using the high strength - reinforcement in composites, surface coatings for abrasion resistance
4. Those using its ability to harden steel - tool steels and armor."
description: "Tungsten is remarkable for its melting point of 3410 C when pure. This is a problem if you want to process it, but an attraction if you want to use it at high temperatures. Processing is solved by using powder methods -- the same methods used to shape refractory ceramics. Its high melting point gives tungsten excellent creep resistance up to 1400 C (the temperature listed below as the maximum service temperature), but if not under load it can be used at much higher temperatures - photoflood bulbs reach 2200 C, though they have a short life."
