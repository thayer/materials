description: "PC is one of the 'engineering' thermoplastics, meaning that they have better mechanical properties than the cheaper 'commodity' polymers. The family includes the plastics polyamide (PA), polyoxymethylene (POM) and polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE). The benzene ring and the -OCOO- carbonate group combine in pure PC to give it its unique characteristics of optical transparency and good toughness and rigidity, even at relatively high temperatures. These properties make PC a good choice for applications such as compact disks, safety hard hats and housings for power tools. To enhance the properties of PC even further, it is possible to co-polymerize the molecule with other monomers (improves the flame retardancy, refractive index and resistance to softening), or to reinforce the PC with glass fibers (giving better mechanical properties at high temperatures)."
