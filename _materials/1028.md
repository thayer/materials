general_applications: "Metal foams have promise as stiffeners to inhibit buckling in light shell structures, as energy absorbing units, both internal and external, in motor vehicles and trains, and as cores for light, stiff sandwich panels. Open cell foams have a large exposed surface area that enables their use as heat exchangers for power electronics. Industrial designers have seen potential in exploiting the reflectivity and light-filtering properties of open cell foams, and the interesting surface textures of those with closed cells."
description: "Metal foams are a new class of material, as yet imperfectly characterized but with alluring properties. They are light and stiff; they have good energy-absorbing characteristics (making them good for crash protection and packaging) and attractive heat-transfer properties (used to cool electronic equipment and as heat-exchangers in engines. Some have open cells, very much like polymer foams but with metallic characteristics (ductility, electrical conductivity, weldability and so forth). Others have closed cells, like 'metallic cork'. They are visually appealing, suggesting their use in architecture and interior design. At this point in time there are some 12 suppliers marketing a range of metal foams, mostly based aluminum, but other metals - copper, nickel, stainless steel and titanium - can be foamed. The data listed here are for a typical aluminum-based foam."
