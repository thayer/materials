general_applications: "High temperature filters for liquids and gases; catalyst carriers for chemical processing and catalytic converters; high temperature thermal insulation; as a first step in making 3-dimensionally interpenetrating composites; as a bioactive medium for cell attachment in implants."
description: "If you wanted to filter dross out of a molten metal at -- say -- 1800 C, how would you do it? The answer is to pour it through a ceramic foam. A range of such foams is now available with relative densities between 5% and 40% (the volume fraction of solid in the foam), with pore sizes between 0.05 and 2 mm. They are available in alumina, zirconia, and a number of other ceramics including the bio-ceramic hydroxyapatite. Their great merit is their stability at high temperatures - zirconia foams, for instance, can be use at up to 2000 Cathie data given here is for a medium-density alumina foam."
