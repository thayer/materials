description: "The foundations of modern industrial society are set, so to speak, in cast iron - it is the material that made the industrial revolution possible. Today it holds a second honor - that of being the cheapest of all engineering metals. Cast iron contains at least 2% carbon -- most have 3 to 4% -- and from 1-3% silicon. The carbon makes the iron very fluid when molten, allowing it to be cast to intricate shapes. There are five classes of cast iron - gray, white, ductile (or nodular), malleable and alloy; details are given under Design Guidelines, below. The two that are most used are gray and ductile. This record is for ductile cast iron."
