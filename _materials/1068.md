description: "Titan was a Greek god, remarkable for his size and strength. His name has been appropriated many times, not always aptly (think of the Titanic). But the alloys of titanium merit the association - the strongest of them have the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any structural metal, about 25% greater than the best alloys of aluminum or steel. Titanium alloys can be used at temperatures up to 500 C - compressor blades of aircraft turbines are made of them. They have unusually poor thermal and electrical conductivity, and low expansion coefficients. The alloy Ti 6%Al 4% V is used in quantities that exceed those of all other titanium alloys combined. The data in this record describes it and similar alloys."
