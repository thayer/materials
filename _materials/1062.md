A hollow tube used extensively in the construction industry.

**General Properties**: A uniform and pale yellow. Unlike other woods, bamboo has no rays or knots, allowing it to withstand more stress. Bamboo contains different chemical extractives than hardwood, which make it better suited for gluing.

**Applications**: Building and scaffolding, roofs and flooring, pipes, buckets, fishing poles, window blinds, and wooden mats.
