description: "The US 5¢ piece is, as its name suggests, almost pure nickel. Look at one - much can be learned from it - that nickel is a ductile, silvery metal, easily formed by stamping (or rolling or forging), hard when worked, and with good resistance to corrosion. Not bad for 5¢. Nickel has a high melting point (1450 C) and is one of the few elements that are ferro-magnetic (with Fe and Co). You don't see pure nickel very often, but its alloys are everywhere. Alloyed with copper it is widely used for coinage (the Euro, the 'silver' dollar, the British 50 p piece). As Nichrome, a Ni-Cr alloy, it forms the heating elements of electric fires, toasters and hair dryers. Alloyed with iron and chromium it becomes stainless steel, familiar in every kitchen. And most exotic of all are the range of nickel-based materials known as 'superalloys' because of their exceptional combination of high temperature strength and corrosion resistance. This record is for pure nickel. There are separate records for stainless steels, nickel-chromium alloys and superalloys."
