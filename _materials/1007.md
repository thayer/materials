description: "Plaster of Paris is exactly that - a plaster that, originally, came from Paris, France. It is made by calcining the mineral gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O, at about 180Â°C, driving off water to give the anhydrite 2CaSO4.H2O. When mixed with water it rehydrates and sets to a hard, white solid. It is used to make molds and casts for ceramics and sculptures, to make pre-cast ornamental plasterwork on ceilings and cornices, and for orthopedic bandages or casts. In medieval and renaissance times gesso (plaster of Paris mixed with glue) was applied to wood panels or canvas as the ground for tempera paintings."
