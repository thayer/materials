description: "Cellulose is one of the main structural polymers in plants (specifically that of wood or cotton). These natural fibers are treated with acids to produce a resin, a process called 'esterification'. Cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) are three common cellulose materials. CA combines toughness, transparency and a natural surface texture. Some cellulose resins are biodegradable allowing their use for envelopes with transparent windows that can be disposed of as if they were paper alone."
