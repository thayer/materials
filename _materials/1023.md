description: "Carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) offer greater stiffness and strength than any other type, but they are considerably more expensive than GFRP (see record). Continuous fibers in a polyester or epoxy matrix give the highest performance. The fibers carry the mechanical loads, while the matrix material transmits loads to the fibers and provides ductility and toughness as well as protecting the fibers from damage caused by handling or the environment. It is the matrix material that limits the service temperature and processing conditions."
