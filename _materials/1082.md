description: "Ionomers, introduced by DuPont in 1964, are flexible thermoplastics but they have ionic cross-links, from which they derive their name. Their thermoplastic character allows them to be processed by blow molding, injection molding and thermoforming, and to be applied as coatings. But cooled below 40C they acquire the characteristic of thermosets - high strength, good adhesion and chemical stability."
