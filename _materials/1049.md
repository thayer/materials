description: "Medium carbon steel (0.25-0.7% carbon) hardens when quenched - a quality that gives great control over properties. 'Hardenability' measures the degree to which it can be hardened in thick sections; plain carbon steels have poor hardenability - additional alloying elements are used to increase it (see Low alloy steels). Medium carbon steels are used on an enormous scale for railroad tracks; there are many other lower-volume applications."
