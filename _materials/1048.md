general_applications: "Low carbon steels are used so widely that no list would be complete. Reinforcement of concrete, steel sections for construction, sheet for roofing, car body panels, cans and pressed sheet products give an idea of the scope."
description: "Think of steel and you think of railroads, oilrigs, tankers, and skyscrapers. And what you are thinking of is not just steel, it is carbon steel. That is the metal that made them possible - nothing else is the same time so strong, so tough, so easily formed - and so cheap. Carbon steels are alloys of iron with carbon and, often a little manganese, nickel, and silicon. Low carbon or 'mild' steels have the least carbon - less than 0.25%. They are relatively soft, easily rolled to plate, I-sections or rod (for reinforcing concrete) and are the cheapest of all structural metals - it is these that are used on a huge scale for reinforcement, for steel-framed buildings, ship plate and the like."
