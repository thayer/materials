description: "Papyrus, the forerunner of paper, was made from the flower stem of the reed, native to Egypt; it has been known and used for over 5000 years. Paper, by contrast, is a Chinese invention (105 AD). It is made from pulped cellulose fibers derived from wood, cotton or flax. There are many different types of paper and paper board - tissue paper - newsprint, kraft paper for packaging, office paper, fine glazed writing paper, cardboard - and a correspondingly wide range of properties. The data below span the range of newsprint and kraft paper."
