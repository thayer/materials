description: "Softwoods come from coniferous, mostly evergreen, trees such as spruce, pine, fir and redwood. Wood must be seasoned before it is used. Seasoning is the process of drying the natural moisture out of the raw timber to make it dimensionally stable, allowing its use without shrinking or warping. In air-seasoning the wood is dried naturally in covered but open-sided structure. In kiln-drying the wood is artificially dried in an oven or kiln. Modern kilns are so designed that an accurate control of moisture is achieved. Wood has been used for construction and to make products since the earliest recorded time. The ancient Egyptians used it for furniture, sculpture and coffins before 2500 BC. The Greeks at the peak of their empire (700 BC) and the Romans at the peak of theirs (around 0 AD) made elaborate buildings, bridges, boats, chariots and weapons of wood, and established the craft of furniture making that is still with us today. More diversity of use appeared in Mediaeval times, with the use of wood for large-scale building, and mechanisms such as pumps, windmills, even clocks, so that, right up to end of the 17th century, wood was the principal material of engineering. Since then cast iron, steel and concrete have displaced it in some of its uses, but timber continues to be used on a massive scale, particularly in housing and small commercial buildings."
