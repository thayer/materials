description: "Silicones are high-performance, high cost materials. Silicone and fluoro-silicone elastomers have long chains of linked O-Si-O-Si- groups (replacing the -C-C-C-C- chains in carbon-based elastomers), with methyl (CH3) or fluorine (F) side chains. They have poor strength, but can be used over an exceptional range of temperature (-100 C to + 300 C), have great chemical stability, and an unusual combination of properties (Silly Putty is a silicone elastomer - it bounces when dropped but flows if simple left on the desk)."
