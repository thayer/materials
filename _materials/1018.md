description: "Silicon carbide (SiC, carborundum), made by fusing sand and coke at 2200 C, is the grit on high quality sandpaper. It is very hard and maintains its strength to 1400C high temperature, has good thermal shock resistance, excellent abrasion resistance, but, like all ceramics, it is brittle. It has the highest corrosion resistance of all advanced ceramics."
