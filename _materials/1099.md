description: "Bakelite, commercialized in 1909, triggered a revolution in product design. It was stiff, fairly strong, could (to a muted degree) be colored, and - above all - was easy to mold. Products that, earlier, were handcrafted from woods, metals or exotics such as ivory, could now be molded quickly and cheaply. At one time the production of phenolics exceeded that of PE, PS and PVC combined. Now, although the ration has changed, phenolics still have a unique value. They are stiff, chemically stable, have good electrical properties, are fire-resistant and easy to mold - and they are cheap."
