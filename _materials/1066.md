general_applications: "Tin is used in pure form in storage tanks for pharmaceutical chemical solutions, as electrodes of capacitors, and fuse wire and as organ pipes (though usually alloyed with some lead). Its most important applications, however, are as a coating on steel sheet ('tin plate') and as an alloying element in bronze, pewter and solder. Its salts are used as polymer additives, for antifouling paints, and to produce a transparent, conducting coating on glass."
description: "Tin (symbol Sn) has been know to man since at least 3500 BC. The discovery that copper alloyed with tin to give bronze, greatly improving the mechanical properties, launched the Bronze age. In 1800 Napoleon offered prize of 12,000 francs for a method for preserving food for his armies. The tin can (steel coated with tin), which revolutionise the storage and preservation of foodstuffs and liquids, was invented in 1810, ironically by an Englishman; the first commercial canning factory opened just 3 years later."
