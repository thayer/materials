description: "Polymer foams are made by the controlled expansion and solidification of a liquid or melt through a blowing agent; physical, chemical or mechanical blowing agents are possible. The resulting cellular material has a lower density, stiffness and strength than the parent material, by an amount that depends on its relative density - the volume-fraction of solid in the foam. Rigid foams are made from polystyrene, phenolic, polyethylene, polypropylene or derivatives of polymethylmethacrylate. They are light and stiff, and have mechanical properties the make them attractive for energy management and packaging, and for lightweight structural use. Open-cell foams can be used as filters, closed cell foams as flotation. Self-skinning foams, called 'structural' or 'syntactic', have a dense surface skin made by foaming in a cold mold. Rigid polymer foams are widely used as cores of sandwich panels."
