description: "Brick is as old as Babylon (4000 BC) and as durable. It is the most ancient of all man-made building materials. The regularity and proportions of bricks makes them easy to lay in a variety of patterns, and their durability makes them an ideal material for the construction of building. Clay - the raw material from which brick are made - is available almost everywhere; finding the energy to fire them can be more of a problem. Pure clay is gray-white in color; the red color of most bricks comes from impurities of iron oxide."
