description: "Pure iron is soft stuff. Add carbon and heat-treat it right, and you can get a material that is almost as hard and brittle as glass, or as ductile and tough as boiler plate. 'Heat treat' means heating the steel to about 800 C to dissolve the carbon, then quenching (rapid cooling, often by dropping into cold water) and tempering - reheating it to a lower temperature and holding it there. Quenching turns the steel into hard, brittle 'martensite'; tempering slowly restores the toughness and brings the hardness down. Control of tempering time and temperature gives control of properties. It's wonderful what 1% of carbon can do. But (the inevitable 'but') the cooling rate in that initial quench has to be fast - more than 200 C/second for plain carbon steels. There is no difficulty in transforming the surface of a component to martensite, but the interior cools more slowly because heat has to be conducted out. If the component is more than a few millimeters thick, there is a problem - the inside doesn't cool fast enough. The problem is overcome by alloying. Add a little manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), or chromium (Cr), and the critical cooling rate comes down, allowing thick sections to be hardened and then tempered. Adding some vanadium, V, as well allows a dispersion of carbides giving strength while retaining toughness and ductility. Chrome-molybdenum steels such as AIS 4140 are used for aircraft tubing and other high strength parts. Chrome-vanadium steels are used for crank and propeller shafts and high quality tools. Steels alloyed for this purpose are called low alloy steels, and the property they have is called 'hardenability'."
