description: "Polylactide, PLA, is a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from natural lactic acid from corn, maize or milk. It resembles clear polystyrene, provides good aesthetics (gloss and clarity), but it is stiff and brittle and needs modification using plasticizers for most practical applications. It can be processed like most thermoplastics into fibers, films, thermoformed or injection molded."
