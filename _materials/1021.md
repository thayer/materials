description: "Zirconia, ZrO2, is a ceramic with an exceptionally high melting point -- 2760 C when pure. It has the highest useful strength and toughness at room temperature of all the readily available ceramics. It is used (with 5% CaO) as a firebrick, and, in sintered form (with MgO or Y2O3 additives) for high strength, high temperature applications. The exceptional toughness is imparted by transformation toughening - a change in crystal structure from tetragonal to monoclinic, with an associated change in volume of the ZrO2 crystals when subjected to stress at a crack tip. The volume expansion squeezes the crack shut, impeding crack growth. Transformation toughening is made possible by additions of magnesia, MgO, or yttria, Y2O3, to give PSZ (partially stabilized zirconia) or TZP (tetragonal zirconia polycrystal). Zirconia is also available as foam for thermal insulation and filtration, and as fibers, used to make fabrics that can tolerate temperatures up to 2425 C."
