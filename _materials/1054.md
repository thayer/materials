general_applications: "70-30 Brasses - deep drawn parts such as cartridge and shell casings; musical instruments and other objects made by sheet-metal working; decorative components for architecture; marine components; condenser and cooling units; jewelry.
60-40 Brasses - tubing for condensers; heat exchangers; valve and pump parts; taps and water pipes; fasteners and springs."
description: "Brasses are alloys of copper (Cu) with 5 - 40% zinc (Zn). They combine excellent formability and machinability with good corrosion resistance. As the zinc content increases the melting point, density, modulus and electrical and thermal conductivities decrease; the expansion coefficient, the strength and the hardness increase."
