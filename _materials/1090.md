description: "When you think of PMMA, think transparency. Acrylic, or PMMA, is the thermoplastic that most closely resembles glass in transparency and resistance to weathering. The material has a long history - discovered in 1872, first commercialized in 1933, its first major application was as cockpit canopies for fighter aircraft during the second World War."
