general_applications: "45% of production is for electronics and 25% for end user products with 10% for medical applications. PCBs, capacitor film, engine bay components, sterilizable medical components, textile rollers for use where cast nylons are not sufficient, hairdryer, oven, microwave, and iron components, used for high clarity windows in product cases - e.g. dental floss, medical components, food processing equipment, electronics, valve bodies, under-bonnet components, housings."
description: "Best considered as a group of materials similar to aromatic polycarbonates but which are able to withstand more rigorous conditions of use. Due to their higher price, they are usually only considered when PC or other cheaper polymers are unsuitable. In many fields of use they have replaced ceramics, metals, and thermosets rather than other thermoplastics."
