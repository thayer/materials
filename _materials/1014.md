description: "Alumina (Al2O3) is to technical ceramics what mild steel is to metals - cheap, easy to process, the workhorse of the industry. It is the material of spark plugs, electrical insulators and ceramic substrates for microcircuits. In single crystal form it is sapphire, used for watch faces and cockpit windows of high-speed aircraft. More usually it is made by pressing and sintering powder, giving grades ranging from 80 to 99.9% alumina - the rest is porosity, glassy impurities or deliberately added components. Pure aluminas are white; impurities make them pink or green. The maximum operating temperature increases with increasing alumina content. Alumina has a low cost and a useful and broad set of properties - electrical insulation, high mechanical strength, good abrasion and temperature resistance up to 1650 C, excellent chemical stability and moderately high thermal conductivity, but it has limited thermal shock and impact resistance. Chromium oxide is added to improve abrasion resistance; sodium silicate, to improve processability but with some loss of electrical resistance. Competing materials are magnesia, silica and borosilicate glass."
