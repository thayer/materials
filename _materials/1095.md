description: "Think of polyurethanes and you think of soft, stretchy materials and fabrics (Lycra or Spandex), but they can also be leathery or rigid. Like PVC, polyurethanes have thermoplastic, elastomeric and thermosetting grades. They are easily foamed; some 40% of all PU is made into foam by mixing it with a blowing agent. The foams can be open- or closed-cell, microcellular or filter grades. PU is a versatile material."
