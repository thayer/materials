general_applications: "Limestone is widely used for building and sculpture. It is calcined in large quantities to make lime (CaO) for cement and as a flux in the smelting of iron."
description: "Limestone is formed of petrified sea-creatures. In its pure form it is chalk (when porous) or marble (when fully dense). Most limestone is not pure but contains sand (silicate) and other minerals. The most interesting limestones contain visible shells and other fossils of the creatures from which they derived. It is easy to cut; where it is available it is widely used as a building stone."
