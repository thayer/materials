description: "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are linear polyesters produced in nature by bacterial fermentation of sugar or lipids derived from soybean oil, corn oil or palm oil. They are fully biodegradable. More than 100 different monomers can be combined within this family to give materials with a wide range of properties, from stiff and brittle thermoplastics to flexible elastomers. The most common type of PHAs is PHB (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate) with properties similar to those of PP, though it is stiffer and more brittle. A copolymer of PHB, polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate (PBV) is less stiff and tougher. It is used as a packaging material. The data below are for PHB."
