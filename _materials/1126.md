description: "Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is an organic polymer consisting of aromatic rings linked with sulfides. Synthetic fiber and textiles derived from this polymer are known to resist chemical and thermal attack. PPS is used to make filter fabric for coal boilers, papermaking felts, electrical insulation, specialty membranes, gaskets, and packings. PPS is the precursor to a conducting polymer of the semi-flexible rod polymer family. PPS, which is otherwise insulating, can be converted to the semiconducting form by oxidation or use of dopants. PPS is an engineering plastic, commonly used today as a high-performance thermoplastic. It can be molded, extruded, or machined to high tolerances. In its pure solid form, it may be opaque white to light tan in color. Maximum service temperature is 218 C."
