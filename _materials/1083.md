general_applications: "Light duty gears, bushings, sprockets and bearings; electrical equipment housings, lenses, containers, tanks, tubing, furniture casters, plumbing connections, bicycle wheel covers, ketchup bottles, chairs, toothbrush bristles, handles, bearings, food packaging. Nylons are used as hot-melt adhesives for book bindings; as fibers - ropes, fishing line, carpeting, car upholstery and stockings; as aramid fibers - cables, ropes, protective clothing, air filtration bags and electrical insulation."
description: "Back in 1945, the war in Europe just ended, the two most prized luxuries were cigarettes and nylons. Nylon (PA) can be drawn to fibers as fine as silk, and was widely used as a substitute for it. Today, newer fibers have eroded its dominance in garment design, but nylon-fiber ropes, and nylon as reinforcement for rubber (in car tires) and other polymers (PTFE, for roofs) remains important. It is used in product design for tough casings, frames and handles, and - reinforced with glass - as bearings gears and other load-bearing parts. There are many grades (Nylon 6, Nylon 66, Nylon 11....) each with slightly different properties."
