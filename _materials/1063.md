description: "With a name like 'superalloy' there has to be something special here. There is. Superalloy is a name applied to nickel-based, iron-based and cobalt-based alloys that combine exceptional high-temperature strength with excellent corrosion and oxidation resistance. Without them, jet engines would not be practical - they can carry load continuously at temperatures up to 1200 C. The nickel-based superalloys are the ultimate metallic cocktail - nickel with a good slug of chromium and lesser shots of cobalt, aluminum, titanium, molybdenum, zirconium and iron. The data in this record span the range of high-performance nickel-based superalloys."
