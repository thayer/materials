description: "Walnut heartwood is a heavy, hard, open-grained hardwood. Freshly cut live wood may be Dijon-mustard colour, darkening to brown over a few days. The dried lumber is a rich chocolate-brown to black, with cream to tan sapwood, and may feature unusual figures, such as 'curly', 'bee's wing', 'bird's eye', and 'rat tail', among others. It is prized by fine woodworkers for its durability, lustre and chatoyance."
