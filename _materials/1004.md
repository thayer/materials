description: "Soda lime glass is the glass of windows, bottles and light bulbs, used in vast quantities, the commonest of them all. The name suggests its composition - 13-17% NaO (the 'soda'), 5-10% CaO (the 'lime') and 70-75% SiO2 (the 'glass'). It has a low melting point, is easy to blow and mold, and it is cheap. It is optically clear unless impure, when it is typically green or brown. Windows today have to be flat and that was not - until 1950 - easy to do; now the float-glass process, solidifying glass on a bed of liquid tin, makes 'plate' glass cheaply and quickly."
