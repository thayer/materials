description: "In Victorian times you washed your clothes in a 'copper' - a vat or tank of beaten copper sheet, heated over a fire; the device exploited both the high ductility and the thermal conductivity of the material. Copper has a distinguished place in the history of civilization - it enabled the technology of the Bronze age (3000 BC - 1000 BC). It is used in many forms - as pure copper, as copper-zinc alloys (brasses), as copper-tin alloys (bronzes), and as copper-nickel and copper-beryllium. The designation of 'copper' is used when the percentage of copper is more than 99.3%. It is heavy and soft, not what you want for good mechanical performance. It is in its thermal, electrical, environmental and aesthetic qualities that copper excels. Its thermal and electrical conductivities are greater than those of any other metal except silver, and it is 50 times more expensive. It is exceptionally durable -- copper artifacts 2500 years old survive today; it is one of the reasons that it is used for coinage. And it is visually attractive - copper objects are prized, and prestige buildings are clad with it."
