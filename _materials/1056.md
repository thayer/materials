A polymer very similar to PTFE and PFA, and is sold under the brandname Teflon FEP.

**General Properties**: Compared to PTFE and PFA, more flexible, lower tensile strength, softer, and lower melting points.

**Applications**: Wiring (e.g. hookup wire, coaxial cable, wiring for computer wires), and in aerospace industry.
