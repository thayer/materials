description: "Polystyrene is an optically clear, cheap, easily molded polymer, familiar as the standard 'jewel' CD case. In its simplest form PS is brittle. Its mechanical properties are dramatically improved by blending with polybutadiene, but with a loss of optical transparency. High impact PS (10% polybutadiene) is much stronger even at low temperatures (meaning strength down to -12C). The single largest use of PS is a foam packaging."
