description: "POLYETHYLENE, (-CH2-)n, first synthesized in 1933, looks like the simplest of molecules, but the number of ways in which the - CH2 - units can be linked is large. It is the first of the polyolefins, the bulk thermoplastic polymers that account for a dominant fraction of all polymer consumption. Polyethylene is inert, and extremely resistant to fresh and salt water, food, and most water-based solutions. Because of this it is widely used in household products, food containers like Tupperware and chopping boards. Polyethylene is cheap, and particularly easy to mold and fabricate. It accepts a wide range of colors, can be transparent, translucent or opaque, has a pleasant, slightly waxy feel, can be textured or metal coated, but is difficult to print on."
