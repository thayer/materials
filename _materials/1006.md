description: "Concrete is a composite, and a complex one. The matrix is cement; the reinforcement, a mixture of sand and gravel ('aggregate') occupying 60-80% of the volume. The aggregate increases the stiffness and strength and reduces the cost (aggregate is cheap). Concrete is strong in compression but cracks easily in tension. This is countered by adding steel reinforcement in the form of wire, mesh or bars ('rebar'), often with surface contours to key it into the concrete; reinforced concrete can carry useful loads even when the concrete is cracked. Still higher performance is gained by using steel wire reinforcement that is pre-tensioned before the concrete sets. On relaxing the tension, the wires pull the concrete into compression; the concrete does not crack until the loads applied to it overcome this compression stress ('pre-stressed concrete')."
