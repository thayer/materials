description: "The name polyester derives from a combination of 'Polymerization' and 'esterification'. Saturated polyesters are thermoplastic - examples are PET and PBT; they have good mechanical properties to temperatures as high as 175 C. PET is crystal clear, impervious to water and CO2, but a little oxygen does get through. It is tough, strong, easy to shape, join and sterilize - allowing reuse. When its first life comes to an end, it can be recycled to give fibers and fleece materials for clothing and carpets. Unsaturated polyesters are thermosets; they are used as the matrix material in glass fiber/polyester composites. Polyester elastomers are resilient and stretch up to 45% in length; they have good fatigue resistance and retain flexibility at low temperatures."
