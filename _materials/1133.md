description: "All rosewoods are strong and heavy, taking an excellent polish, being suitable for guitars, marimbas, recorders, turnery, handles, furniture, and luxury flooring, etc. Rosewood oil, used in perfume, is extracted from the wood of Aniba rosaeodora, which is not related to the rosewoods used for lumber. In general, world stocks are poor through overexploitation. Rosewood is now protected worldwide. At the recent summit of the international wildlife trade in South Africa, CITES moved to protect the worldâ€™s most trafficked wild product by placing all 300 species of the rosewood tree under trade restrictions."
