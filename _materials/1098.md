general_applications: "Pure epoxy molding compounds - the encapsulation of electrical coils and electronics components; epoxy resins in laminates - pultruded rods, girder stock, special tooling fixtures, mechanical components such as gears; adhesives, often for high-strength bonding of dissimilar materials; patterns and molds for shaping thermoplastics."
description: "Epoxies are thermosetting polymers with excellent mechanical, electrical and adhesive properties and good resistance to heat and chemical attack. They are used for adhesives (Araldite), surface coatings and, when filled with other materials such as glass or carbon fibers, as matrix resins in composite materials. Typically, as adhesives, epoxies are used for high-strength bonding of dissimilar materials; as coatings, they are used to encapsulate electrical coils and electronic components; when filled, they are used for tooling fixtures for low-volume molding of thermoplastics."
