description: "Titanium is the seventh most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, but extracting the metal from the oxide in which it occurs naturally is unusually difficult. This makes titanium, third member of the light alloy trio, by far the most expensive of the three (more than ten times the price of aluminum). Despite this, the use of titanium is growing, propelled by its remarkable properties. It has a high melting point (1677 C), it is light, and - although reactive - its resists corrosion in most chemicals, protected by a thin film of oxide on its surface. Titanium has unusually low thermal and electrical conductivity, and low expansion coefficients."
