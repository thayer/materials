general_applications: "Jute is used chiefly to make cloth for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make sacks and coarse cloth. The fibers are also woven into curtains, chair coverings, carpets, area rugs, hessian cloth, and backing for linoleum."
description: "Jute is a long, soft, shiny vegetable fiber made from plants in the genus Corchorus, family Malvaceae. Like kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen) and ramie, jute is a bast fiber plant, one in which the fibers extracted from the stem or bast. Jute is one of the cheapest natural fibers and is second only to cotton in amount produced and variety of uses. It can be spun into coarse, strong threads. When woven it is called hessian or burlap. There is growing interest in using jute as reinforcement in composites, replacing glass."
