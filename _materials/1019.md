general_applications: "Rotating bearing balls and rollers; cutting tools; engine parts - valves, turbocharger rotors; cam followers, tappet shims; gas turbine blades, vanes, buckets; metal forming rolls and dies; precision shafts and axles in high wear environments; heaters and igniters; molten metal processing, particularly in the aluminum foundry industry."
description: "Silicon nitride, Si3N4, is a man made compound, synthesized as a powder through several different chemical reactions. Parts made from these powders are sintered by standard methods to produce a ceramic with a unique set of properties. High performance silicon nitrides were developed for automotive engine wear parts such as valves, cam followers and turbocharger vanes, and have proved effective although the cost has not yet dropped enough to allow widespread use. The very high quality bodies developed for these applications are now used for parts for other high temperature applications in chemically aggressive environments in which wear is a problem."
