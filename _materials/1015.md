description: "Aluminum nitride, (AlN) has an unusual combination of properties - it is an electrical insulator, but an excellent conductor of heat. This is just what is wanted for substrates for high-powered electronics; the substrate must insulate yet conduct the heat out of the microchips. This, and its high strength, chemical stability and low expansion give it a special role as a heat sinks for power electronics. It is transparent to microwaves and RF frequencies, and thus makes good microwave windows."
