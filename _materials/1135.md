general_applications: "Sisal is used by industry in three grades, according to www.sisal.ws. The lower grade fiber is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium grade fiber is used in the cordage industry for making: ropes, baler and binders twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fiber after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.
Sisall is now used as a reinforcement in polymer-matrix composites."
description: "Sisal fiber is derived from an agave, Agave sisalana. Sisal is valued for cordage use because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater."
