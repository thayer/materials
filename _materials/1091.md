general_applications: "POM is more expensive than commodity polymers such as PE, so is limited to high performance applications in which its natural lubricity is exploited. It is found in fuel-system; seat-belt components; steering columns; window-support brackets and handles; shower heads, ballcocks, faucet cartridges, and various fittings; quality toys; garden sprayers; stereo cassette parts; butane lighter bodies; zippers; telephone components; couplings; pump impellers; conveyor plates; gears; sprockets; springs; gears; cams; bushings; clips; lugs; door handles; window cranks; housings; seat-belt components; watch gears; conveyor links; aerosols; mechanical pen and pencil parts; milk pumps; coffee spigots; filter housings; food conveyors; cams; gears; TV tuner arms; automotive underhood components."
description: "POM was first marketed by DuPont in 1959 as Delrin. It is similar to nylon but is stiffer, and has better fatigue and water resistance - nylons, however, have better impact and abrasion resistance. It is rarely used without modifications - most often filled with glass fiber, flame retardant additives or blended with PTFE or PU. The last, POM/PU blend, has good toughness. POM is used where requirements for good moldability, fatigue resistance and stiffness justify its high price relative to mass polymers, like polyethylene, which are polymerized from cheaper raw materials using lower energy input."
