description: "Zinc is a bluish-white metal with a low melting point (420 C). The slang in French for a bar or pub is 'le zinc'; barcounters in France used to be clad in zinc - many still are - to protect them from the ravages of wine and beer. Bar surfaces have complex shapes - a flat top, curved profiles, rounded or profiled edges. These two sentences say much about zinc - it is ductile; it is hygienic; it survives exposure to acids (wine), to alkalis (cleaning fluids), and to misuse (upset customers). These remain among the reasons it is still used today. Another is the 'castability' of zinc alloys - their low melting point and fluidity gives them a leading place in die-casting."
