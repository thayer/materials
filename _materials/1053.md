general_applications: "1000 series - foil, sheet, wire, food equipment, electrical conductors and bus-bars, coatings for mirrors and reflectors. 
3000 series - sheet, beverage can-stock, siding and roofing, cooking utensils, extrusions.
5000 series - sheet and tubing, extrusions for marine and transport applications."
description: "Aluminum is the most important of the light alloys, second only to steel in the volume of its use. When pure it is extremely ductile (it can be rolled to foil only a few microns thick) and corrosion resistant. Pure aluminum has a thermal and electrical conductivity about 60% that of copper (alloying reduces both), and it is only one third as dense. This record is for the series of wrought Al alloys that rely on solution hardening and do not exploit heat treatment. Here they are, using the IADS designations (see Technical notes for details).1000 series - pure Al (99+%) -- familiar as kitchen foil and electrical conductors.3000 series - Al with up to 1.5% Mn -- it can be found in the bodies of drink cans.5000 series - Al with up to 5% Mg -- peel off tops of drink cans, welded structures and pressure vessels; certain variants are superplastic.8000 series - a hodge-podge of special alloys used developed for aerospace and the nuclear industry. So this record is broad, encompassing all of these. None are particularly strong - the 1000 series have strengths around 90 MPa and the strongest 5000 series only reach 300 MPa; but they are robust, not requiring carefully controlled heat treatments that are destroyed by welding."
