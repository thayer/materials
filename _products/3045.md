Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET): A plastic resin and a form of polyester
Linear Low Density Polyethylene: Compared to LDPE: higher tensile strength, higher impact strength and puncture resistance, lower thickness films can be blown; highest environmental stress cracking resistance of the PEs

Injection molding: Molten plastic is injected into a steel molding where it is cooled
Extrusion blow molding: Melted plastic blown into a long, thin tube for molding
