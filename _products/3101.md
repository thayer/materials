product_description: "Natural sea sponges are far superior to synthetic sponges in their durability and absorbency, In fact, natural sponges are still used for purposes other than bathing, ranging from car washing to rug cleaning because of their incredible durability. Natural sea sponges are easy to care for. Just wqueeze out the water and keep in a dry place in your bathroom. Sponge will air dry completely and is naturally resistant to bacterial growth. If, for some reason, your sponge needs freshening, you can soak for 24 hours in a very mild bleach solution (1 tsp. per gallon). Natural sea sponges have been used for bathing since the days of the Roman Empire. Our natural sea sponges are harvested by hand in the shallow waters of the Culf of Mexico. Sponges are cut from the ocean floor and grow back in 5-7 years."
