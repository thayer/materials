product_description: "The Twist Loofah Sponge is the one that started it all. Artificial colors, plastics and chemical dyes are in your kitchen, like that neon yellow sponge with the bright green scrub side. We have a feeling that's not exactly natural. Our loofah sponge shows its true colors: an unbleached, undyed white cellulose and tan, scrubby loofah. It's totally plant based and compostable, just like the food it cleans up after."
