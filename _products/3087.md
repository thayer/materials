materials_and_processes_description: "1000 series Non age-hardening wrought Al-alloys: 'Commercially pure' wrought family with the benefits of being relatively lightly alloyed (compared to other series), such as high electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, and workability
Paper and cardboard: A thick paper-based material

Smelting: To extract the pure aluminum in a furnace and combine with alloys
Hot shape rolling: Passing the material through a series of heated shaped rolls to press and flatten sheets
Cold shape rolling: Passing the material through a series of shaped rolls to press and flatten sheets
Cropping/guillotine: The upper blade is forced past a lower one to shear sheet material along a
straight line
Recycling: Aluminum and paper recycling used for product and packaging respectively
Spiral-winding: Paper and cardboard tube shaped by winding
Cyanoacrylates adhesion: Paper and cardboard tube held in shape with glue
Pulping and drying: Processes to make thin sheets of Paper and cardboard
Printing: Used to apply product labels, instructions, warning, and advertisements"
