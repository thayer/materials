product_description: "Everyone enjoys a good party but cleaning up the dirty dishes after a long night of socializing is often the least exciting part of the day. Dishes are stacked high and you know for sure that not one guest washed their plate off. That means you get to stick your hands in the dirty dishes and endure the various different textures of soaked food. However, thereâ€™s a way to keep your hands clean while you clean up the dishes. This pair of gloves is made of 100% natural latex with a sprinkled cotton inside, keeping your hands clean and dry while your dishes get all the suds. The design covers up to your wrists so nothing can get in. With the impenetrable texture, use this to protect yourself while cleaning around the house and using potentially harmful chemicals. Add these to your daily cleaning supplies."
materials_and_processes_description: "Natural rubber: Latex, the sap of the rubber tree, is cross-linked (vulcanized) by heating with sulfur; the amount of the cross-linking determines the properties. It is the most widely used of all elastomers - more than 50% of all produced
Cotton: A soft fluffy usually white material made up of twisted hairs that surrounds the seeds of a tall plant of warm regions and is spun into thread or yarn

Dip forming: Dipping a hand-shaped ceramic former into the rubber
Vulcanization: To dry the rubber without cracking it
Cuff beading: Rolling the cuffs to make the gloves easier to remove
Cotton powder coating: Dusting inside of gloves with cotton
Recycling: Paper recycling used for packaging
Pulping and drying: Processes to make thin sheets of Paper and cardboard
Cropping/guillotine: The upper blade is forced past a lower one to shear sheet material along a straight line
Printing: Used to apply product labels, instructions, warning, and advertisements"
