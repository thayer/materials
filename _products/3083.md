product_description: "The Twist Loofah Sponge is the one that started it all. Artificial colors, plastics and chemical dyes are in your kitchen, like that neon yellow sponge with the bright green scrub side. We have a feeling that's not exactly natural. Our loofah sponge shows its true colors: an unbleached, undyed white cellulose and tan, scrubby loofah. It's totally plant based and compostable, just like the food it cleans up after."
materials_and_processes_description: "Cellulose: Derived from wood pulp, sodium sulphate, and hemp fiber
Low Density Polyethylene: Very cheap, good chemical and hydrolysis resistance, high impact strength at low temperatures, excellent electrical properties, transparent in thin films, good processability 

Soaking: Done in a vat of chemicals to soften the cellulose and rid of impurities
Polyurethane gluing: To glue the scouring pad on 
Cold shape rolling: Passing the material through a series of shaped rolls to press the sheets together
Cropping/guillotine: To cut the shapes of the sponge and wrapper
Extrusion blow molding: Melted plastic blown into a long, thin tube for molding
Printing: Used to apply product labels, instructions, warning, and advertisements"
