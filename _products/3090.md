product_description: "If You Care® Unbleached Paper Snack and Sandwich Bags are made exclusively from the unbleached pulp of Scandinavian spruce trees—a natural, renewable resource. They are not treated with petroleum-based paraffin wax or any other wax. The pure wood pulp is specially ground and pressed to form a natural barrier that prevents grease or fat from penetrating, making them ideal for sandwiches that use mayo or oil. Like all If You Care® paper products, these sandwich and snack bags are gluten free, allergen free, chlorine-free, and are certified compostable for home/backyard and industrial/municipal composting. 48-ct."

Pulping and drying: Processes to make thin sheets of paper and cardboard
