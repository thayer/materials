product_description: "The HandCraft Petite Sirah is all about jammy fruit from beginning to end. It starts with aromas of cherry, plum and cocoa followed by flavors of blueberry, coffee and spice. This full-bodied wine has a bold tannin structure and balanced acidity that lead to a long finish. This big wine is anything but 'petite.'"
