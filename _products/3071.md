Paper and cardboard: A thick paper-based material

Injection molding: Molten plastic is injected into a steel molding where it is cooled
Pulping and drying: Processes to make thin sheets of thin sheets of pulp and Paper and cardboard
Powder rolling: To rid of moisure in the wood pulp to make thin paper
Calendaring: Feeding through continuous rolls to create a long sheet
Cropping/guillotine: The upper blade is forced past a lower one to shear sheet material along a straight line
Texturing: Used to puncture filtration holes and create designs and patterns
Hot stamping: For the logo and labels
