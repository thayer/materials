product_description: "There are many famous pairings; peanut butter and jelly, wine and cheese, shoes and socks... and now Steel Pints and ReFleece cozies. Each cozie is lovingly made by ReFleece using colorful, recycled fleece from Patagonia's Common Threads Initiative, and a durable, stiff backer made from recycled PET bottles. Slide one on and easily keep track of your pint. Clip on a carabiner and enjoy a little insulation. So long sweaty sidewalls!"
