product_description: "This versatile, 800-speed film picks up where 400-speed films leave off. When used indoors, the faster speed extends your flash distance. Outdoors, it stops fast action and allows a faster shutter speed. ULTRA MAX 800 film reduces blur in fast-action shots and captures subjects in low-light conditions. Whether you're going to the racetrack or an indoor stadium, this is the film to use."
