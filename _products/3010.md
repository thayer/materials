product_description: "Everyone enjoys a good party but cleaning up the dirty dishes after a long night of socializing is often the least exciting part of the day. Dishes are stacked high and you know for sure that not one guest washed their plate off. That means you get to stick your hands in the dirty dishes and endure the various different textures of soaked food. However, thereâ€™s a way to keep your hands clean while you clean up the dishes. This pair of gloves is made of 100% natural latex with a sprinkled cotton inside, keeping your hands clean and dry while your dishes get all the suds. The design covers up to your wrists so nothing can get in. With the impenetrable texture, use this to protect yourself while cleaning around the house and using potentially harmful chemicals. Add these to your daily cleaning supplies."
