product_description: "addi TURBOÂ® needles are the original and most popular needles in the addi line. The perfect needle for most projects, their slightly rounded tips work well with all yarns including boucles and lightly twisted fibers. The extra slick nickel plating allows stiches to quickly slide along, a great asset, whether you are looking for speed, or simply knitting for pleasure."
